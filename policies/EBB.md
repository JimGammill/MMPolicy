The best way "to take care of accidents" in school is to prevent them from happening.  Staff and students are responsible for becoming aware of the potential safety hazards within the school and for knowing the rules which protect them from such hazards.  All employees will be trained to protect themselves from the risks of infectious diseases by using Standard precautions while at work.  A comprehensive Health and Safety Plan will include appropriate training for staff and students.
