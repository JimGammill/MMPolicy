The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District desires to prevent unnecessary exposure of students, children and employees to chemical pesticides and reduce the need to rely on chemical pesticides when managing pests.  It is the policy of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District to use chemical pesticides only when pests have been identified and their presence verified.  Selection of treatment option or corrective actions will give priority to non-chemical actions whenever possible to provide the desired control of pests.  Education of staff, students, children, employees and parents about Integrated Pest Management (IPM) will be included to achieve desired objectives.  When it is determined that pesticides are needed, only those allowed by the Children’s and Families’ Protection Act will be used.  Further, only certified and/or licensed individuals will be able to use pesticides.  Our policy prohibits the use of any pesticide by unlicensed staff.  It will be the school’s policy to make the appropriate notification and posting as well as keep records of all pesticide use.  A copy of the IPM plan will be maintained in the Superintendent’s office.  It will be available upon request.
