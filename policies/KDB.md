The School Committee is a public servant, and its meetings and re¬cords will be a matter of public information except as such meetings and records pertain to individual personnel and other classi-fied matters.  The School Committee members’ personal and private contact information will remain confidential.

The School Committee supports the right of the people to know about the programs and services of their schools and will make every effort to disseminate information.  All requests for information will be acted on fairly, completely and expeditiously.

The official minutes of the Committee, its written policies and regulations, and its financial records will be open for inspection at the office of the Superintendent by any citizen desiring to examine them during hours when the office is open.  No records pertaining to individual students or staff members will be released for inspection by the public, or any unauthorized persons, by the Superintendent or other persons responsible for the custody of confidential files.  The exception to this will be information about an individual employee (or student) that has been authorized in writing for release by the employee (or student, or student's parent).

The Principal is authorized to use all means available to keep parents and others in the school's community informed about the school's program and activities.
