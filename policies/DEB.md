The Commonwealth shall, in accordance with the existing state aid formula, annually reimburse regional school districts maintaining regional school district programs. The School Committee may choose to develop additional programs not supported by state tax sources. 

The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District Committee shall annually, in submitting estimates of the amount of money necessary for the proper maintenance of the schools, include its estimate of the amount of school aid that will be received under Chapter 70 of the Massachusetts General Laws.
