In the event of a vacancy in the office of the Superintendent, the following procedures will be followed:

1.	The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee will review its policies with reference to desired qualifications and position description as well as level of salary and benefits.

2.	The School Committee will take special care to assess the needs of the school district with reference to change and stability.  Change, movement, and progress may be in order for the immediate future.  On the other hand the school district may have need for a period of stability with a slower pace of change.  In large measure, a Superintendent sets the tone and pace of educational improvement for the school district.

3.	The School Committee may proceed in one of three ways:  Appoint a sub-committee to act as a search committee; use the whole Committee as a search committee; or secure expert assistance to conduct the search process and submit the names of a limited number of applicants for interview.

4.	Applicants have the responsibility for submitting evidence to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) that they fulfill the certification requirements for the position of Superintendent.  They will also cooperate with any testing or interview requirements of the DESE.  Information provided to the Committee by the DESE will be an important consideration in weighing the relative merits of appropriately credentialed applicants.

5.	Those responsible for carrying out the search for a new Superintendent are reminded of the steps involved in the process:  preparing a presentable and attractive notice of vacancy; publishing the notice of vacancy within and outside the school district; securing applications and credentials of applicants; screening applicants down to a manageable number for interviews and visitations; negotiation of terms; and selection.

6.	No interview shall be granted except at the invitation of the School Committee or the Superintendent search committee.  All interviews will comply with the provisions of the Open Meeting Law.

If at all possible, selection of a new Superintendent should be by unanimous vote of the
School Committee.  Should this not be possible, selection may be made by a two-thirds vote
of the sworn School Committee.
