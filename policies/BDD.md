A natural area of difficulty in maintaining smooth Superintendent-School Committee relationships is in dealing with problems that arise within a school system. Citizens of the community often will mention a problem to members of the School Committee. The Committee member then faces the question of how to deal with this problem.  If the Committee member takes action to solve the problem, he/she infringes upon the administrative function of the Superintendent.  If, instead, the Committee member calls the problem to the attention of the Superintendent, his/her initial responsibility has been fulfilled.  The Superintendent then has the responsibility of dealing with the problem and reporting the consequences of his/her actions.  Individual Committee members can promise no particular solution to a problem, but can only promise that the problem will be investigated and handled by the administration.

The Superintendent, on the other hand, has a responsibility to inform the School Committee whenever an administrative decision or problem appears to be of such significance that the Committee might ultimately become involved in the situation.  It is generally difficult to predict these situations accurately, but the Superintendent should make every effort to do so in these particular cases.

The School Committee should have contact regarding school matters with the staff only through the Superintendent. The Superintendent should be in a position to make all necessary contacts directly with the staff.  As the executive officer of the School Committee, he/she is the point of contact between the staff and the School Committee.  All problems connected with staff members should be handled by the Superintendent and reported to the School Committee.

The School Committee, as the agency designated by the state and the local citizenry, is charged with the responsibility for serving the interests of the people of the local school district and the state.  The School Committee is charged also with the responsibility for the welfare of the teachers and other staff members whose lives are dedicated to the education of children and youth.  The Superintendent shares these charges and these dedications.

The School Committee has a unique responsibility in determining the broad general policies under which the Minuteman Regional School District will function.  The Committee's principal function, other than adopting operational policies and approving the budget, is the selection of the Superintendent.

The Superintendent has a unique role in that he/she is the executive officer of the School Committee and is also the leader of the professional staff; hence responsible to the School Committee. The Superintendentâ€™s primary responsibility, however, is to the boys and girls of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District.  All other responsibilities fall in line 
after this responsibility to children and young people.  The roles of the School Committee and the Superintendent must not only be clearly understood, but definitively practiced to ensure the best possible school program.  The mutual acceptance of roles is key to building the  basic relationship of the School Committee with the Superintendent as its chief executive officer.

If the School District is to prepare future generations to find answers to the problems that perplex our society, the leadership of the school system must continue to be strengthened.  This will be done when the School Committee and the Superintendent, in a spirit of mutual understanding and confidence, form a strong and enduring partnership based upon a clear understanding of their respective roles and are dedicated to the betterment of the school district.
