If a student fails an academic course at the Minuteman Regional High School, the transcript will reflect the course name, grade of F, Credit (0), and the course level. The student may take a summer/outside course for credit for a failed academic course under the following conditions:

- A student who is failing an academic course during the regular school year must remain in the course for the entire year if he/she wishes to take the same course (title) for credit during summer school.
- A student who voluntarily drops an academic course or who is removed permanently from an academic course during the school year will not be allowed to retake the course (title) from which he/she dropped or was removed.  A student may take a different titled academic course for credit. This may be accomplished through standard scheduling or by any approved Internet or correspondence course. Recommendation shall be made to the principal by the Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment. Online learning shall be budgeted. The Department Chairperson and Guidance Counselor must approve all courses taken for credit outside of Minuteman.
- Any expense associated with online learning shall be preapproved by the Superintendent prior to registration or enrollment. 
- A student must achieve a grade of C- or higher in any summer school course, Internet course, or correspondence  course in order to apply credit toward graduation.
- The transcript of a student who takes a summer/outside course will note the course name, grade, and all credit earned. The course will be designated as unleveled and not be computed as part of the overall G.P.A. of the student.
- Any outside course work that a student wishes to enroll in must be approved by his or her guidance counselor.
- A student wishing to take courses online may do so with approval from his or her guidance counselor.
