The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District maintains a Health Services Department that is available to all student and staff during the school day.  The nurses assess students who become ill, or need First Aid or medication during the day.  They also provide health education.  Our mission is to ensure that students are school-ready each day. 

Upon entering Minuteman, a current  physical examination and documentation of up-to-date immunizations is required by state law.  In addition, each year students and parents/guardians are responsible for completing an Emergency Form, with current emergency phone numbers.  Failure to submit these documents may lead to exclusion from shop and extracurricular activities.

No public school teacher, no principal, secretary, clerk, nurse or other public school employee who, in good faith, renders emergency first aid or transportation to a student who has become injured or incapacitated in the School or on the grounds thereof shall be liable in a suit for damages as a result of such acts or omissions either for such first aid or as a result of providing such emergency transportation to a place of safety, nor shall such person be liable to a hospital for its expenses if under such emergency conditions he/she causes the admission of such injured or incapacitated student, nor shall such person be subject to any disciplinary action for such emergency first aid transportation.

A person certified as an athletic trainer or an emergency medical technician shall be on campus during the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) sanctioned home games, and/or as  required by MIAA rules,  and the expenses of such person shall be paid by the School Committee of the District.  As required by MIAA regulations, a physician is contracted and the expenses shall be paid by the School Committee.
