It is the policy of the Minuteman Regional School District to inform parents in the event that students have been exposed to communicable diseases as directed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Office of Health and Human Services. 

Management of common communicable diseases shall be in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines.  A student who exhibits symptoms of a communicable disease may be temporarily excluded from school attendance.  The District reserves the right to require a physician’s statement authorizing the student’s return to school. 

In all proceedings related to this policy, the District shall respect the student’s right to privacy.  Only those persons with a direct need to know shall be informed of the specific nature of the student’s condition.  The determination of those who need to know shall be made by the superintendent.
