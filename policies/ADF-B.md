The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School may ask the following series of questions:

2.	Have you been convicted of a misdemeanor within the past five years (other than a first conviction for any of the following misdemeanors:  drunkenness, simple assault, speeding, minor traffic violations, affray or disturbance of the peace)?  Yes or no?
3.	Have you completed a period of incarceration within the past five years for any misdemeanor (other than a first conviction for any of the following misdemeanors: drunkenness, simple assault, speeding, minor traffic violations, affray or disturbance of the peace)?  Yes or no?
4.	If the answer to question number 3 above is "yes" please state whether you were convicted more than five years ago for any offense (other than a first conviction for any of the following misdemeanors:  drunkenness, simple assault, speeding, minor traffic violations, affray or disturbance of the peace)?  Yes or no?

Some employers are authorized to request, receive, view and/or hold criminal offender record information pursuant to state or federal law.

Any inquiry into the criminal record of an applicant must also contain language pursuant to M.G.L. c. 276, ยง 100A.

It is unlawful for an employer to make any inquiry of an applicant or employee regarding:

1.	An arrest, detention or disposition regarding any violation of law in which no conviction resulted.
2.	First convictions for the misdemeanors of drunkenness, simple assault, speeding, minor traffic violations, affrays or disturbance of the peace.  For the purposes of 804 CMR 3.02 minor traffic violations include any moving traffic violation other than reckless driving, driving to endanger and motor vehicle homicide. 
3.	Any conviction of a misdemeanor where the date of the conviction or the completion of any period of incarceration resulting there from, which ever date is later, occurred five or more years prior to the date of such inquiry, unless such person has been convicted of any offense within five years immediately preceding the date of the inquiry. 

No person shall be held under any provision of any law to be guilty of perjury or of otherwise giving false statement by reason of his failure to recite or acknowledge such information as he has a right to withhold by 804 CMR 3.02.
