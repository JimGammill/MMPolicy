The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District Committee is responsible to the people for whose benefit the school district has been established. The Committee’s current decisions will influence the course of education in our schools for years to come.  The Committee must develop a comprehensive perspective, understanding both the details of the district’s long-range planning and immediate problems.

The School Committee’s primary responsibility is to establish those purposes, programs, and procedures that will best produce the educational achievement needed by our students. The Committee is charged with accomplishing this while also being responsible for wise management for resources available to the school district. The Committee must fulfill these responsibilities by functioning primarily as a legislative body to formulate and adopt policy, by selecting an executive officer to implement policy, and be evaluating the results. It must carry out its functions openly, while seeking the comments of the public, students, and staff in its decisions making process.

In accordance with these principles, the School Committee, through its operations, will seek to achieve the following goals:

1.	To concentrate the Committee’s collective effort on its policy making and planning responsibility.

2.	To formulate Committee policies that best serve the educational interests for each student.

3.	To provide the Superintendent with sufficient and adequate guidelines for implementing Committee policies.

4.	To maintain effective communication with the public the Committee serves and with staff and students in order to maintain awareness of attitudes, trends, opinions, desires, and ideas.

5.	To advocate for and allocate the appropriate resources when formulating the budget to accomplish/achieve the goals in the Committee’s policy making.
