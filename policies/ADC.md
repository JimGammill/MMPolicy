The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District will provide a drug-free workplace and certifies it will:

1.	Notify all employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of controlled substance is prohibited in the District’s workplace, and specify the actions that will be taken against employees for violation of such prohibitions.

2.	Establish a drug-free awareness program to inform employees about the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace; the District’s policy of maintaining a drug-free work place; available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and the penalty that may be imposed on employees for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

3.	Make it a requirement that each employee whose employment is funded by a federal grant be given a copy of the policy as required.

4.	Notify the employee that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee will abide by the terms of this policy, and will notify the District of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction.

5.	Notify the federal granting agency within ten days after receiving notice from an employee or otherwise receiving notice of such conviction.

6.	Take one of the following actions within 30 days of receiving notice with respect to any employee who is so convicted: take appropriate personnel action against such an employee, up to and including termination; or require such employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a federal, state or local health law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.

7.	Make a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free workplace through implementation of all the provisions of this policy.

8.	Notify the school committee of any disciplinary actions made to insure a drug-free workplace, without violating the offender’s rights to privacy.
