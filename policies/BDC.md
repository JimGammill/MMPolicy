The Superintendent shall be hired by the Committee as provided by law and shall serve and perform all the duties that are prescribed by law and such other duties, not inconsistent thereto, as the  majority of the Committee may direct.

The Committee may award a contract to a superintendent of schools and a school business administrator for periods not exceeding six years which may provide for the salary, fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment, including but not limited to, severance pay, relocation expenses, reimbursement for expenses incurred in the performance of duties or office, liability insurance, and leave for said superintendent or school business administrator. (M.G.L. 71:41)

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Committee from voting to employ a superintendent of schools who has completed three or more years’ service to serve at its discretion.

Upon the recommendation of the superintendent, the committee shall appoint and set compensation for an administrator of special education, school physicians and registered nurses (unless employees of the Board of Health), and supervisors of attendance. Consent to hiring based on the superintendent’s recommendation should not be unreasonably withheld.

Upon the recommendation of the superintendent, the Committee may also establish and appoint positions of assistant or associate superintendents, who shall report to the superintendent, and the school committee shall fix the compensation paid to such assistant or associate superintendents. The school committee shall approve or disapprove the hiring of said positions. Such approval by the school committee of the recommendation shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that upon the request of the superintendent the school committee shall provide an explanation of disapproval. (M.G.L. 71:59)
