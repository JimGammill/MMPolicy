M.G.L.150E, secs. 10-15 describes those practices of a public employer, or an employee organization or their designated representative or agent, that constitute prohibited practices relating to the formation or maintenance of employee unions and collective bargaining.  It is the policy of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee in its dealings with all employee organizations that it shall not engage in any action or conduct which would constitute a prohibited practice.
