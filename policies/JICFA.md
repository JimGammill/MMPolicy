The term “hazing” shall mean any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such conduct shall include whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics exposure to the weather, forced consumption of food, liquor, beverage, drug or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity which
is likely to adversely affect the physical health or safety of any such student or other person, or which subjects such student or other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extreme isolation.

The School Committee forbids hazing in any form.  Should an alleged instance of hazing occur, the provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 269 sections 17, 18, and 19 will be followed.  In addition the Superintendent and the School Committee shall immediately be notified of the circumstances of the complaint and the actions taken.

Whoever knows that another person is the victim of hazing and is at the scene of such crime shall, to the extent that such person can do so without danger or peril to himself or others, report such crime to the Dean of Students or an appropriate law enforcement official as soon as reasonably practicable. 

As required by law, the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District shall file, at least annually, a report with the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, certifying that the district has complied with the provisions of this section and also certifying that the school has adopted a disciplinary policy with regards to the organizers and participants of hazing.
