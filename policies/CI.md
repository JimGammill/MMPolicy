In the event the Superintendent is on temporary absence from duty, the Superintendent will designate another administrator to serve as Acting Superintendent.

A temporary absence is defined as a vacation period, attendance at off-site meetings, and/or any other periods when the Superintendent would be out of immediate contact or presence in the district for over twenty-four hours.  

When so appointed, the Acting Superintendent will assume all duties that are the responsibility of the Superintendent, with particular emphasis on emergency and day-to-day decision-making.  The Acting Superintendent will not be expected to deal with matters requiring long-term planning or preparation unless specifically so assigned by the Superintendent.

The Acting Superintendent will take special care to keep the School Committee chairperson informed as to any departure from normal routine.

To ensure continuous administrative control within a school, the Principal will name an administrator to be in charge in the event of his/her absence and to have the authority to act in disciplinary matters regarding M.G.L. Chapter 71, s 34D, 34E, 34F, 37H, 37H 1/2.
