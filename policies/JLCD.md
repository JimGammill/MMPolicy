Medication may not be administered to students while at school unless such medicine is given to them by the school nurse acting under specific written request of the parent or guardian and under the written directive of the student’s personal physician, dentist, nurse practitioner, or physician’s assistant (see below for exceptions).  If a student has been approved for self-administration, a student who needs medication during the school day may be reminded to take the medicine by the school nurse or other individual designated by the school nurse in the student’s medical administration plan.  This provision only applies when the school nurse has a medical administration plan in place for the student.   No one but the school nurse, and those others listed in the medical administration plan acting within the above restriction, may give any medication to any student.

**Exceptions:**
The school District may, in conjunction with the school physician and District nurse leader, stock certain over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and calcium carbonate. The school physician shall write standing medication orders yearly for the District.  The school nurse may administer these medications as long as the parent or guardian has provided written permission on an annual basis. 

The school District shall, through the District nurse leader, register with the Department of Public Health and train personnel in the use of epinephrine auto-injectors to be administered if needed during the school day or school-sponsored event.

The school District may, in conjunction with the school physician and the school nurse leader, stock nasal naloxone (Narcan). Trained medical personnel and first responders may administer nasal naloxone to individuals experiencing a life-threatening opiate overdose in a school setting, including school-sponsored events. 

If the school District wishes medical personnel to train non-medical staff in the administration of nasal naloxone, the Superintendent shall ensure that medical personnel have a written protocol which complies with medical directives and regulations from the Department of Public Health.

Following consultation with the school nurse, and subject to the following Rules for Student Self-Administration of Medication, students who fall into the following exceptions may self-administer medications:

1.	Students with asthma or other respiratory diseases may possess and self-administer prescription inhalers.
2.	Students with cystic fibrosis may possess and self-administer prescription enzyme supplements.
3.	Students with diabetes may possess and self-administer glucose monitoring tests and insulin delivery systems.
4.	Students with life-threatening allergies may possess and self-administer epinephrine.
5.	Students who have been approved by the school nurse, parent/guardian, and prescribing provider may possess and self-administer prescribed medications during field trips or off-campus vocational opportunities. 

**Rules for Student Self-Administration of Medication:**   
The school nurse may permit self-administration of prescription medication by a student, provided that the following requirements are met:

- The student, school nurse and parent/guardian enter into an agreement which specifies the conditions under which the prescription medication may be self-administered;
- The school nurse develops a medication administration plan which contains elements necessary to ensure a safe self-administration of the prescription medication, including information for the safe storage of the prescription medication and providing for accessibility of the medication for the individual student;
- The school nurse is reasonably assured that the student is able to identify the appropriate prescription medication, knows the frequency and time of day for which the prescription medication is ordered, and follows the school self-administration protocols;
- There is on file a written authorization from the student’s parent or guardian that the student may self-medicate;
- There is on file a written order from the licensed prescriber for self-administration;
- The student will keep a backup supply of the prescription medication with the school nurse, as applicable.
