The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District shall provide for and enforce the school attendance of all students actually enrolled in the district school.  The School Committee, administration and faculty are committed to making the learning experiences rewarding and challenging for all students.  We recognize that the greatest level of vocational and academic achievement is possible only when students attend school on a daily basis.

Specific information regarding student attendance is contained in the Student / Parent Handbook, under “Attendance Policy” which is reviewed, published and approved by the School Committee each year.
