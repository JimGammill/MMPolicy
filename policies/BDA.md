The annual meeting of the Committee shall be held at the first regular meeting of the Committee in the month of July of each year for the purpose of electing officers and conducting such other business as may come before the meeting. Officers will be elected by the members present and voting.

At the Annual Meeting in each year the Committee shall organize and elect by ballot a Chair, a Vice-Chair and a Clerk from among its membership. All such officers shall hold office until the next annual meeting or until their successors are elected.

The members shall be called together at the annual meeting by the presiding Chair (typically the Superintendent or another person who is not a member of the Committee). The presiding Chair shall accept nominations for Chair of the Committee and turn the meeting over to the elected Chair after the election has been held. The elected Chair shall then preside over the election of other officers. 
Members may not serve as an officer for more than five successive terms. 

No member shall be elected as Chair or Vice-Chair unless said member has served on the Committee for at least a year prior to election as Chair or Vice-Chair. 

The Chair shall appoint subcommittee and subcommittee chairs subject to the approval of the full Committee.
