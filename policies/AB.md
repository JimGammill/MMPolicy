The public schools belong to the people. The people govern the schools under rights guaranteed to them under the Constitution and statutes of Massachusetts. The School Committee is mindful that the people are the ultimate governors of public education and that the Committee also believes that accountability is a shared responsibility involving students, teachers and other employees, the Superintendent, and the people themselves as well as the School Committee. The Committee therefore asserts these beliefs and expectations:

> Students should be nurtured at home and in the schools in order that they will learn to hold themselves accountable for their own lives, actions, and decisions as maturing members of a democratic society.
>
>Teachers should hold students accountable for achieving (within the limits of each studentâ€™s abilities) the objectives of each learning experience.
>
>The Superintendent should hold teachers and other employees accountable for working with diligent effort and with intelligence and imagination in achieving the objectives directly related to their stated job responsibilities.
>
>The Committee should appoint the most capable person available to hold the position of Superintendent and should hold him or her accountable for providing creative professional leadership and counsel in all aspects of the school district program. The public should also hold itself accountable for carrying out its mandate to plan, to make policy, and to lead in the identification of goals and objectives and the resources necessary for their achievement.
>
>The public should hold itself accountable for maintaining a vigorous interest in, concern for, and constructive criticism of the schools; for choosing the most able men and women available to represent them on the School Committee and in the State Legislature and U.S. Congress; and for providing the resources necessary for the Committee and staff to accomplish the long-term goals and objectives of the school district.
