### Video Surveillance (Video Cameras) and CCTV (Closed Circuit Television)

The Minuteman School Committee agrees to allow the use of video surveillance to promote the safety and security of students and staff, the protection of school property, deterrence and the prevention of criminal activities and the enforcement of school rules.

#### DEFINITIONS
Video surveillance is a term that refers to video-audio-digital components of multi-media.

#### GUIDELINES: VIDEO MONITORING ON SCHOOL PROPERTY 
**Camera Location, Operation and Control**

 - School buildings and grounds may be equipped with video monitoring devices.
 - Video surveillance may be placed in areas where surveillance is necessary, as a result of threats, prior property damage, security incidents or security recommendations made by public safety officials or school administrators.
 - Cameras shall not be used to monitor inside change rooms, locker rooms, and washrooms.
 - Only individuals authorized by the Superintendent of Schools in accordance with policy, shall have access to video monitors, or be permitted to operate the controls.
 - The Superintendent of Schools or designees shall be responsible to manage and audit the use and security of monitoring cameras; monitors; hard drive storage; VCR Storage; computers used to store images; computer diskettes and all other video and electronic records.

**Notification**
 
 - All staff shall be made aware of the Minuteman video surveillance guidelines and practices.
 - At each site where video surveillance is employed, the school principal shall inform students, staff, and parents at the beginning of each school year that video surveillance will occur throughout the school year and explain the purpose for such monitoring practice.  Appropriate signage will be posted at major public entrances.

**Use of Video Recordings**

 - A video recording of actions by students may be used by the authorized Minuteman administrator as evidence in any disciplinary action brought against students arising out of the student's conduct in or about Minuteman property.
 - Video surveillance recordings of students, staff, or others may be reviewed or audited for the purpose of determining adherence to Minuteman policy and school rules.
 - Minuteman administrators may use video surveillance of students, staff, and others to detect or deter criminal offenses that occur in view of the camera.
 - Minuteman administrators may use video surveillance and the resulting recordings for inquiries and proceedings related to law enforcement, deterrence, and student discipline.

**Protection of Information and Disclosure/Security and Retention of Video Data**

 - All video data must be securely stored.
 - All video data that have been used for the purpose of this policy shall be numbered and dated and retained according to the camera site.
 - The Superintendent of schools or designee must authorize access to all video electronic data.
 - Documentation shall be maintained of all episodes of access to, or use of recorded materials.
 - Video electronic data normally will be erased on a bi-monthly basis.  Video data that contain personal information used to make a decision directly affecting an individual or a discipline case, however, may be retained for a longer period of time, as needed.

**Disposal or Destruction of Video Data**

 - All recordings shall be disposed of in a secure manner.

**Video Monitors and Viewing**

 - Only individuals authorized by the Superintendent of Schools shall have access to video monitors while they are in operation.
 - Video monitors should be in controlled access areas wherever possible.
 - Records should be viewed on a need-to-know basis only, in such a manner as to avoid public view.  Video data that constitutes part of a student record shall be maintained and disseminated in accordance with federal and state laws addressing student records.
