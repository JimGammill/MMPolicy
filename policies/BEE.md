In conducting all public hearings required by law, and others, as it deems advisable, the School Committee will:

1.	Give due and public notice in line with statutory requirements,

2.	Make available printed information on the topic of the hearing; and

3.	Give all persons an equal opportunity to be heard in accordance with the Committee's policy.

The Chairperson of the Committee will preside at the hearing.

The public will be informed at the beginning of the hearing of the particular procedure that will be followed in regard to questions, remarks, rebuttals, and any time limitations or other rules that must be followed to give as many people as possible an opportunity to be heard.

In conformance with customary hearing procedures, statements and supporting information will be presented first by the Committee, or by others for the Committee.  To comment, citizens must be recognized by the Chair, and all remarks must be addressed to the Chairperson and be germane to the topic.  To assure that all who wish get a chance to speak, the Chairperson  will recognize persons who have not commented preÂ¬viously during the hearing before recognizing persons who wish to remark a second time.
