The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District has a Student Internet Policy that is included in the Student Handbook.  This policy defines acceptable use. All uses of Minuteman’s Internet access must be in support of and consistent with the educational objectives in the Student-Parent Handbook. All students who use Minuteman’s Internet access are expected to read this policy and/or to take part in a discussion of the policy with a teacher. Adherence to the policy is a condition for student and staff privilege to Internet access.
