All accidents must be reported to the school nurse immediately.  

The circumstances of any accident which occurs within the School buildings or upon the School grounds shall be set forth in writing on a form by those staff members having the greatest knowledge of the incident giving rise to the accident.  All such reports shall be delivered to the Superintendent or his designee who shall meet with the author(s) of the report to discuss the nature of the accident, the injuries suffered by anyone, and the actions which should be undertaken by the School to address the conditions which may have contributed to the accident and prevent those events from recurring.
