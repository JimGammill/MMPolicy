The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District has no fixed number of professional position descriptions.  The number of such positions is determined by the Superintendent.  Position descriptions are required for every employee position in the School District.  A position description should apply to each major type or kind of position.  The District should classify all of its employees into “groups” or “types” to the extent possible.  

Whenever possible, the “major responsibilities” should be written in a single, “non-subdivided” list.  For positions in which the role is unduly complex, a limited number of “major responsibilities” should be listed with the specific duties listed as sub-points under each major responsibility.  

In the event of a vacancy in any position, it may be appropriate to update the list of responsibilities.
