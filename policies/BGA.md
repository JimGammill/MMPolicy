#### Formulation of Policies

The Superintendent shall, in cooperation with the staff, formulate and recommend for adoption policies designed to maintain a high quality educational institution that meets the needs of its students. The School Committee as the controlling body is charged with the responsibility of establishing policies and maintaining the best possible education conditions for the District.  The primary function of the Committee is the determination of general policies for and the exercise of general supervision of the District School, but its Superintendent and professional staff thereof shall carry out the details and administration.

The Committee shall concern itself primarily with broad questions of policy rather than with administrative details.  The Superintendent shall utilize the best judgment of the professional staff in formulating a sound educational program, shall recommend policies for adoption to the Committee, and shall administer policies enacted by the Committee.  The adopted policies shall represent a combination of the judgment of the members of the Committee and the professional judgment of the Superintendent and his/her staff, adopted officially as Committee policy.  Having determined its policies, the Committee shall stand squarely behind those employees whose work it is to put the policies into practice.

In formulating policies, the Committee shall adopt general principles that provide authorization for the Superintendent and professional staff.  Such policies shall be broad enough to determine or indicate a line of action to be taken by the Superintendent in meeting a number of specific problems and jobs.  Application of such policies to individual situations will be the responsibility of the Superintendent, who shall be held responsible for the effective administration and supervision of the entire system.  

#### Policy Development System

Adopting and changing policies is solely the responsibility of the School Committee.

Proposals from any Committee member, citizen of one of the district towns or cities, any employee of the School Department, or any student of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School shall be referred to the Superintendent.

The Superintendent shall be responsible for reviewing the proposed policy request and drafting a statement for School Committee consideration in accordance with School Committee policy.

In the case where the School Committee chooses to update its entire policy manual in less than two years, it shall use an electronic storage and review system for developing policy sections, if possible.  All policies under review shall be reviewed and edited by a consultant, the Superintendent, and a policy task force and made available in an internet portal for the review and comment of the school committee members.  At the next meeting of the committee, the committee will revise and adopt any policies which are ready for approval (a first reading).  The Superintendent will ensure that finalized copies of policies approved at first reading are returned to the internet portal for further review.  At the following meeting of the committee, or as deemed appropriate, the committee will vote to approve the policies for “second reading.”  Those policies that have been through first and second readings will be considered adopted and will become part of the policies of the school district.
