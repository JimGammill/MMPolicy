Authority for the purchase of materials, equipment, supplies, and services is extended to the Superintendent through the detailed lisÂ¬ting of such items compiled as part of the budget-making process.

The purchase of items and services on state approved lists requires no further Committee approval except when by law or Committee policy the purchases or services must be put to bid.
