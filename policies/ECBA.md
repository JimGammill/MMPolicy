**Statement of Purpose:**   
The Committee wishes to make school facilities available to the community for educational, cultural, and civic events.  Recognizing that those using our facilities will be of all ages and that our campus is an educational environment, our campus buildings, facilities and resources may not be used by individuals or groups that advocate illegal activities, that engage in sexually explicit, indecent, or lewd conduct or speech.  School facilities may not be used in any manner nor for any purpose that threatens to be materially and substantively disruptive. 

Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District and its associated programs shall have priority use.  All other area public schools in the member district shall have priority use based upon availability. 

Second priority shall be to community-based, civic, educational, and municipal **not-for-profit** organizations *within the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District* member towns.  Activities of a cultural, educational, or recreational nature are appropriate. 

The third category of use will include non-profit organizations from outside the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District area.  These users will be charged reduced facility and related fees. 

The fourth category (and priority) of potential users consists of private and/or for-profit organizations.  These activities shall not be scheduled if they interfere with the conduct of school or related approved activities or programs.  However, once any application for facilities use has been approved and the rental and related fee obligations have been met, the booking is considered secure. 

During any time of construction and/or renovation, the Administration shall seek to provide educational and community access while considering the safety and health of all occupants.  Administration has the responsibility to prohibit or limit the use of any particular areas as the phasing of the construction project proceeds.

The superintendent-director (or designee) is the approving authority.  Requests denied may be reconsidered by the superintendent-director if warranted and requested. 

**Categories of Use (Listed in order of priority):**

1.	Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District related functions, organizations and associated programs; public schools and their school related organizations within the member schools and associated programs throughout the district (no extra custodial, rental, or technical fees will be charged). 

2.	Community-based, civic, educational, and municipal **not-for-profit** organizations *within the* member district.  In most cases, no rental fees for the facility will be charged.  Additional custodial, security or related charges may be charged in accordance with the intended use and these procedures.

3.	Non-profit organizations *outside the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District* member district.  Reduced rental and related fees will be charged.

4.	For-profit and private organizations for approved activities and functions appropriate to a school setting will be charged fees in accordance with the commercial rate.

**Insurance:**   
Category 3 and 4 (see above) lessees shall provide a certificate of insurance up to the amount of $1,000,000.00 covering the period under contract as specified by Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District policy.  The insurance shall name the Minuteman Regional School District as an additional insured.  Generally, a certificate of insurance will be required if a fee is charged for public entertainment and the event is not sponsored by a local school organization or town government organization. 

**Deposit:**   
A rental deposit is required for non-profit and for-profit organizations.  The deposit will be one quarter (1/4) of the applicable rental and related fees.  The deposit is required once the principal/director has approved the request.

**Damages and Losses:**  
The lessee is financially responsible for any damage to the facilities.  Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District is not responsible for loss or damage of articles brought to the facility. 

**Custodial Services:**   
Custodial services are required for all events in which the building will be utilized. A fee for custodial services will be charged in accord with the activity, No private third party services may be used by any approved lessee.  The basic service will be to unlock doors, provide necessary equipment, and clean and secure the facility following use.  All equipment (school owned or other) to be moved must be done so under the supervision of the custodian or person designated by facilities manager(s). 

**Event Manager:**   
Any use of a facility resource which involves specialized equipment such as the kitchen for food preparation; lighting and sound; exercise equipment in the gymnasiums; computers in the classrooms and laboratories, or shop areas etc., will require the employment of an Event Manager trained and approved by the school administration.  The Event Manager will instruct users as needed and supervise the use of such equipment.  Cost of the employment of the Event Manager will be in addition to any rental costs and may be in addition to any custodial services. 

**Supervision of Facilities:**    
The lessee is responsible for the active supervision of those attending the event or participating in the lesseeâ€™s activities.  Where required by the school administration or by state/local regulations, or board policy, event security must be provided at the lessee's expense.  It shall be determined by the administration and the approving authority if local police or Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District security (or both) will be required at the event.

**Substance Use:**    
Alcohol possession or consumption and use of tobacco products are prohibited anywhere on school property and grounds. 

**Cancellation of an Event:**   
The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District superintendent-director, or his/her designee has sole authority to determine whether the facilities should be closed for reasons of public safety. Notification will be made as soon as possible.  Contracts in force for periods during which the school is closed for reasons of public safety are cancelled automatically without penalty to either party.  However, every effort will be made to reschedule any canceled event to a mutually acceptable date. 

**Long-Term Use:**.  
Long-term use of any facility will be considered to be one or more successive weeks. Long-term use of facilities will be considered after it is first ascertained that there will be no detriment to existing programs from this use.  If space is available without detriment, space may be rented to groups whose activities are most consistent with the other activities taking place in the building.  Therefore, service agencies, educational groups, and youth oriented activities would have preference. 

Fees will be established by the administration that cover operating costs of these spaces (i.e., lights, heat, maintenance, insurance).  If a profit-making group wishes to rent available space, the fee should be consistent with the going rate for comparable square footage (to be determined through consultation with local realtors and property managers).  The rental of a classroom by an individual or private school shall be at a rate published in administrative procedures.  Individual contracts for the long term use and duration of the rental agreement may be prepared by the superintendent-director and presented to the School Committee for its information.
