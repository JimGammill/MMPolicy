The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee appreciates the place and importance of a career and technical educational system in its greater environment, which includes other organizations and institutions dedicated to education.  It believes that much is gained through cooperative endeavors with other agencies.		

In order to make a maximum contribution to education, within the school system and to other educational agencies, the Committee establishes these broad goals:		

1.  To encourage liaison with other educational agencies in which the cooperative effort will further the mission of the district.		

2.  To collaborate with other educational, workforce and community based organizations agencies and employers.
