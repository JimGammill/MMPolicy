Through its overall safety and security program and various policies pertaining to school 
personnel, the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee will seek to promote the safety of employees during their working hours and assist them in the maintenance of good health. 

Physical examinations will be required of bus drivers, custodians, and food services employees. 

The Superintendent may require an employee to submit to a physical examination by a 
physician appointed by the school system whenever that employee’s health appears to be a risk 
to children or others in the school system or when a doctor’s certificate is needed to verify 
issues related to sick leave. 

Identification Badges: In order to promote a safer and more secure school environment for 
students, staff and visitors, all school staff shall clearly and conspicuously display a Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District photo I.D. card at all times during school hours. Photo I.D. badges and lanyards will be provided for all school staff. 

Keys: Staff may request a key for their personal classroom or office area. Any and all staff scheduled into a classroom/office may request a key, without charge, for their professional use. The key remains the property of Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District and must be turned in to the administration upon request, or upon leaving employment of the district.
