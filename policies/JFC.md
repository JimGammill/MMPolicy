Since the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District seeks to provide education of the highest quality to all students, it is the policy of the District to insure that students are appropriately placed.

No student sixteen years of age or older shall be considered to have permanently left the High School unless a School administrator has sent notice within a period of ten days from the student’s fifteenth consecutive absence to the parent or guardian of such student in both the primary language of such parent or guardian and English, stating that such student and his parent of guardian may meet with the Principal or his designee, prior to the student permanently leaving school, within ten days after the sending of the notice.  The time for meeting may be extended at the request of the parent or guardian and with consent of the School Committee or its designated representative, provided no extension shall be for longer than fourteen days.  Such meeting shall be for the purpose of discussing the reasons for the student permanently leaving school and alternative educational or other placements.
