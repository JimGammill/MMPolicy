Acting under state law and guidelines from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee will periodically review the instructional program.

The Administration and professional staff are directly responsible for the instructional program. The Committee will encourage and support the staff in its efforts to examine curriculum and instruction.

Curriculum development will be consistent with the state curriculum frameworks as outlined in Chapters 71 and 74 of the Massachusetts General Laws. 

Recommendations for improving the curriculum or the organization of instruction will be made through the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall keep the School Committee informed of changes in curriculum planning and development.
