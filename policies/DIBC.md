The school district shall maintain an Excess and Deficiency (E & D) Fund.  At the end of every fiscal year, any surplus or deficit in the District’s general fund shall be closed to the Excess and Deficiency Fund.  

**Certification Process**   
On or before October 31 of each year, the School District shall submit to the Department of Revenue the forms and schedules as the Department of Revenue requires for the purpose of reviewing and certifying the balance in the School District’s  Excess and Deficiency Fund.  At the discretion of the Commissioner, the Department may withhold release of all or some part of the quarterly state school aid for the School District if the School District has not filed the required forms and schedules by such date.  

**Use of E&D Funds**   
The regional School Committee may use all or part of the certified balance in the Excess and Deficiency Fund as a revenue source for its proposed budget. If the certified balance exceeds five percent of the proposed budget, the regional School Committee shall use the amount in excess of five percent as a revenue source for its proposed budget. Beyond this amount,  expenditures cannot be made directly from  the fund.  To expend, funds must be transferred into the general budget.  This action requires a majority vote of the School Committee and majority approval of member towns.  To obtain this, the School Committee must send  notification to member towns within fifteen days of said vote.  Towns have sixty days to convene a Town Meeting to approve by two-thirds vote of the district towns or disapprove the expenditure.  Failure for a town to vote disapproval within the required time period will constitute approval.  (MGL Ch. 71, Sec. 16B1/2)
