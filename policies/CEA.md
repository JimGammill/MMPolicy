The School Committee believes that the school is the key unit for educational improvement and change and that successfull school improvement is best accomplished through a school-based decision-making process.

As enacted by the state legislature in the Education Reform Act of 1993, a School Council shall be established in each school to advise the Principal in specific areas of school operation.  The Principal, except as specifically defined in the law, shall have the responsibility for defining the composition of, and forming the group, pursuant to a representative process approved by the Superintendent and School Committee.

The law outlines four major areas of responsibility for councils. School councils are to assist principals in:
1.	Adopting educational goals for the school that are consistent with local educational policies and statewide student performance standards
2.	Identifying the educational needs of students attending the school
3.	Reviewing the annual school building budget
4.	Formulating a school improvement plan
  
For any school that contains grades nine to twelve, inclusive, the council shall review the student handbook each spring to consider changes in disciplinary policy to take effect for the following school year. 
  
In addition, the law states that "nothing contained in this section shall prevent the school committee from granting a school council additional authority in the area of educational policy; provided, however, that school council shall have no authority over matters which are subject to chapter one hundred and fifty E of the General Laws."
