Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District offers community education and workforce education programs for adult learners. These programs provide instruction to adult learners who are no longer in high school.  Exceptions to this policy may only be made by the Superintendent or his designee.

Detailed policies relating to books, materials, and fees are published by the Community Education Office and may be found on the Minuteman [website](https://www.minuteman.org).
