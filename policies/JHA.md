The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District has published a Tardiness Policy which may be found in the Student / Parent Handbook.  Continual violation of this policy will require the student along with his/her parents to meet with the Assistant Principal and/or the Attendance Appeals Committee (AAC).
