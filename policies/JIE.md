Students who are pregnant shall be entitled, during and after pregnancy, to receive all services and to participate in all programs and activities for which they are eligible unless expressly prohibited by a physician. Should a physician deem it inadvisable for a pregnant student to attend school for an extended period of time, all services granted to home bound students under School Committee policies shall be made available.
