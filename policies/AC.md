Public schools have the responsibility to overcome, insofar as possible, any barriers that prevent students from achieving their potential. The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District will do its part. This commitment to the community is affirmed in the following statements of School Committee intent to:

1. Promote the rights and responsibilities of all individuals as set forth in the State and Federal Constitutions, pertinent legislation, and applicable judicial interpretations.
2. Encourage positive experiences in human values for children, youth and adults, all of whom have differing personal and family characteristics and who come from various socioeconomic, racial, religious and ethnic groups.
3. Carefully consider, in all the decisions made within the School District, the potential benefits or adverse consequences that those decisions might have on the human relationships within the school community.

Through its School Committee, the District declares that it does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, national origin, religion, color, age, sex, ancestry, genetic information, marital/parental status, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity in its programs or activities, including its admissions and employment practices. Additionally, the District does not discriminate against individuals on the basis of homelessness, consistent with the McKinney-Vento Act. The School District further declares that it does not tolerate harassment or discrimination based on race, creed, national origin, religion, color, age, sex, ancestry, genetic information, marital/parental status, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or homelessness.

This policy of non-discrimination extends to all students and staff, the general public, and individuals doing business with the District.

To ensure compliance with this non-discrimination policy, the Superintendent shall designate one or more individuals to serve as Civil Rights/Title IX Coordinators. Complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of race, creed, national origin, religion, color, age, sex, ancestry, genetic information, marital/parental status, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or homelessness may be brought to a Civil Rights/Title IX Coordinator for investigation. This includes complaints under Title IX or Section 504. The contact information for the District’s Civil Rights/Title IX Coordinator is as follows:
