Good citizenship in schools is based on respect and consideration for the rights of others.		

Students will be expected to conduct themselves in a way that the rights and privileges of others are not violated.  They will be required to respect school authority, to conform to school rules and to those provisions of law that apply to their conduct.

The exclusion or expulsion of a student from school will be in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 71, Section, 37H. The grounds for exclusion or expulsion include but are not limited to the following:

(a)	Any student who is found on school premises or at school-sponsored or school-related events, including athletic games, in possession of a dangerous weapon, including, but not limited to, a gun, a knife, or their facsimile, or anything used in the commission of assault and battery; or a controlled substance as defined in Chapter 94 C, including, but not limited to, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, may be subject to expulsion from the school or school district by the principal.

(b)	Any student who assaults a principal, assistant principal, teacher, teacher’s aide, or other educational staff on school premises or at school-sponsored or school-related events, including athletic games, may be subject to expulsion from the school or school district by the principal. 

(c)	Any student who is charged with a violation of either paragraph (a) or (b) shall be notified in writing of an opportunity for a hearing; provided, however, that the student may have representation, along with the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses at a hearing before the principal. After said hearing, a principal may, in his/her discretion, decide to suspend rather than expel a student who has been determined by the principal to have violated either paragraph (a) or (b). 

(d)	Any student who has been expelled from a school district pursuant to these provisions shall have the right to appeal to the Superintendent. The expelled student shall have ten days from the date of the expulsion in which to notify the Superintendent of his/her appeal. The student has the right to counsel at a hearing before the Superintendent. The subject matter of the appeal shall not be limited solely to a factual determination of whether the student has violated any provisions of this section.

(e)	When a student is expelled under the provisions of this section and applies for admission to another school for acceptance, the Superintendent of the sending school shall notify the Superintendent of the receiving school of the reasons for the pupil’s expulsion.

**Note:**   
A student who is found to have assaulted another student is subject to suspension by the administration and expulsion by the School Committee.

All Students are expected to meet the requirements for behavior as set forth in the Student / Parent Handbook.  Federal and state laws require that additional provisions be made for students who have been found by an evaluation team to have special needs and whose program is implemented under an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).   It is the policy of the District to conform to federal and state laws with respect to the discipline of students with disabilities.
