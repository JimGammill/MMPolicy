The basic line of communication between the School Committee and the staff will be through the Superintendent.

#### Staff Communication to the School Committee

All communications or reports to the Committee or any of its subcommittees from Principals, supervisors, teachers, or other staff members will be submitted through the Superintendent. This procedure does not deny the right of any employee to appeal to the Committee for administrative decisions on important matters, except those matters that are outside of the Committee’s legal authority, provided the Superintendent has been notified of the forthcoming appeal and that it is processed in accordance with the Committees policy on complaints and grievances. Staff members are also reminded that Committee meetings are public meetings. As such, they provide an excellent opportunity to observe firsthand the Committee’s deliberations on problems of staff concern.

#### School Committee Communications to Staff

All official communications, policies, and directives of staff interest and concern will be communicated to staff members through the Superintendent. The Superintendent, working with the Principal, will develop appropriate methods to keep staff informed of the Committee’s concerns and actions.

#### Visits to the School

Individual School Committee members interested in visiting the school or classrooms will inform the Superintendent of such visits and make arrangements for visitations through the Principal. Such visits will be regarded as informal expressions of interest in school affairs and not as “inspections” or visits for supervisory or administrative purposes. Official visits by Committee members will be carried on only under Committee authorization.
