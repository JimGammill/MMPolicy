Employees will be placed on the appropriate salary schedule on the basis of their experience and assigned responsibilities.

The Superintendent is responsible for the assignment of the employee to his/her specific position.

With the advice of supervising personnel, the Superintendent will establish work schedules for all non-instructional employees.

The decision to transfer an employee from one position to another will be based on consideration of factors such as:

1.	Desires of the employee and his/her present immediate superior.
2.	Quality of work now being performed.
3.	Length of service.
4.	Possible desired changes in the present position.
5.	The advisability of increased or reduced responsibilities.
6.	The general welfare of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District.

It is the responsibility of the Superintendent to make all decisions related to the transfer of employees, in accord with collective bargaining agreements where appropriate.
