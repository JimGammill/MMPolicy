Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District complies with regulations regarding the transfer of students.  When any child leaves the high school because of change of residence to another town in the Commonwealth, the Superintendent or his/her designee, shall furnish such child with a transfer card in a form prescribed by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education which shall contain, in addition to any other information relative to him/her, his/her name, age, grade in school, and in every case possible, his/her new street and number, and shall forthwith send a duplicate thereof to the Superintendent of schools of the town where the child is to reside.

If a student enrolled at Minuteman Regional High School moves out of the Minuteman district,   his/her continued enrollment at Minuteman is not guaranteed, subject to Chapter 74 laws and regulations on nonresident Tuition.

**TRANSFER FROM ANOTHER DISTRICT**

Applications from students who are enrolled in a Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education approved Chapter 74 vocational technical high school program in another school (transfer students) will be considered for admission (including admission during the school year) if they withdraw from their current school, wish to pursue the same program of study at Minuteman and relocate into a member community of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District. Students who relocate to a non-member community and wish to pursue the same program of study at Minuteman may apply, but must seek and obtain the approval of the local school superintendent following established state Chapter 74 nonresident policies prior to admission and enrollment. All transfer applicants must meet all standard admissions policy criteria including attending an interview at Minuteman. If the applicant or parent/guardian cannot provide transportation, an official from Minuteman will go to the local school to interview the applicant and parent or guardian. His/her application will be evaluated according to the provisions of the approved Admission Policy.
