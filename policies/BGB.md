The policies of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee shall be subject to amendment only upon a majority vote of all the members of the Committee at two consecutive meetings in the call for which the proposed amendment has been described in writing.

To permit time for study of all policies or amendments to policies and to provide an opportunity for interested parties to react, proposed policies or amendments would be presented as an agenda item to the Committee in the following sequence:

1.	Discussion item - first reading of proposed policy or policies; response from Superintendent; report from any subcommittee assigned responsibility in the area; Committee discussion and directions for any redrafting;

2.	Discussion item - second reading of proposed policy or policies; response from Superintendent; report from any subcommittee assigned responsibility in the area; Committee discussion and directions for any redrafting;

3.	Action item -- discussion, adoption or rejection.

Amendments to the policy at the action stage will not require repetition of the sequence, unless the Committee so directs.

The School Committee may dispense with the above sequence to meet emergency conditions.

Policies will become effective upon the date set by the School Committee.  This date will ensure that affected persons have an opportunity to become familiar with the requirements of the new policy prior to its implementation.
