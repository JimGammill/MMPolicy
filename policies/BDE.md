#### Subcommittees

(a) Subcommittees may be established by the Committee at any time to carry out a specified task or function and report thereon periodically to the Committee. Each subcommittee shall be discharged upon completion of its assigned task and, in any event, at the annual meeting next following its establishment, unless the Committee at that time votes to continue its existence.

(b) Process for the establishment of subcommittees: The chairperson of the Committee shall appoint all subcommittees, subject to approval by the full Committee, and may serve as ex officio member of all subcommittees, except when otherwise directed by the Committee.

(c) The committee may establish a warrant subcommittee of no less than three members for the purpose of signing payroll warrants and accounts payable warrants to allow for the release of checks; provided, however, that such subcommittee shall make available to the committee at the next meeting, a record of such actions of such subcommittee.

(d) A subcommittee shall make recommendations to the Committee, but shall not make decisions on behalf of the Committee. 

#### School Building Committee

The Committee may appoint a school building committee which shall have such powers and duties relative to the construction, reconstruction, remodeling, repair, expansion or equipping of school buildings or facilities as the committee determines. The school building committee will be composed of persons from a representative sample of member communities and shall include persons whose expertise may include but not be limited to construction, finance and large project management. Members of the school building committee are subject to all Massachusetts General Laws relating to conflict of interest.
