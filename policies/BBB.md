The Minuteman Regional District School Committee, hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Committee, shall consist of one member from each member town. The members of the Committee shall be appointed as hereinafter provided. All members shall serve until their respective successors are appointed and qualified.

#### Initial Committee

Within ten days after the establishment of the regional school district, the moderator of each member town shall appoint one member *to serve* on the Committee, each of whom shall have been a member of the regional school district planning board which submitted this agreement if such person is available and willing to serve. The twelve members so appointed shall serve on the Committee until their respective successors are appointed and qualified as provided in subsection 1 (C).

#### Appointed Members

On or before April 1, 1972, the moderators of such of the towns of Acton, Arlington, Boxborough and Carlisle as shall become members of the District pursuant to Section XII shall each appoint one member to serve on the committee for a term of one year; the moderators of such of the towns of Belmont, Concord, Lincoln, and Sudbury as shall become members of the District pursuant to Section XII shall each appoint one member to serve on The Committee for a term of two years; and the moderators of such of the towns of Lexington, Stow, Wayland, and Weston as shall become members of the District pursuant to Section XII shall each appoint one member to serve on the Committee for a term of three years.

The moderator of each town that shall be admitted to the District pursuant to Section VIII of this Agreement shall, prior to the date on which admission takes effect, appoint one member to serve on the Committee beginning on such date for a term of three years, or for such shorter term, as may be necessary to retain symmetry of terms on the Committee as a whole. Prior to the date on which the admission of one or more new member towns is to become effective, the Committee shall determine (by lot, if there is more than one such town) the initial term of the member appointed by the moderator of each such town, unless such initial term is specified in this Agreement. In every year in which the term of office of a member expires, the moderators of the respective member towns shall each appoint one member to serve for a term of three years. The term of each member of the Committee shall commence on July 1 of the year in which he or she is appointed.
