The School Committee may establish a Warrant Subcommittee of no less than three members for the purpose of signing payroll warrants and accounts payable warrants to allow for the release of checks. Unless otherwise stated, the Finance Subcommittee will serve this function.

All claims for payment from School Department funds will be pro¬cessed in accordance with procedures approved by the Superintendent.  Payment will be authorized against invoices properly support¬ed by approved purchase orders, with properly submitted vouchers, or in accordance with salaries and salary schedules approved by the School Committee.

As an operating procedure, the Warrant Subcommittee will, at least each month, review lists of bills for payments from School Department funds. The lists will be certified as correct and approved for payment by the Warrant Subcommittee and then forwarded to the District Treasurer for processing and subsequent payment. Finance Subcommittee minutes will include a list of the warrants approved. Actual invoices, statements, and vouchers will be available for inspection by the Warrant Subcommittee and School Committee 

The Superintendent will be responsible for assuring that budget allocations are observed and that total expenditures do not exceed the amount allocated in the budget for all items.
