The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee holds as a first priority the health and safety of its students.  Therefore, it requires that the food services program for the district students shall provide healthy, nutritious meals at a reasonable cost, encouraging students to develop lifelong habits of good nutrition.

As per statute, the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee shall establish, maintain, operate and expand a school food service program for its pupils, may make all contracts necessary to provide material, personnel and equipment needed to carry out the provisions of the National School Lunch Act; and, if necessary, may expend funds to meet the matching requirements and any other provisions the Act, and such other acts as are provided for in section one of chapter fifteen.

The Committee may use funds disbursed to them under the provisions of this act, gifts and other funds received from sale of school lunches and other meals under such programs.

1.	Such contributions received in the form of money, together with fees from the sale of lunches, other meals and any allotments received from the state under the provisions of this act for said purposes, shall be deposited with the treasurer of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District and held as a separate account and expended by the Committee without appropriation, notwithstanding the provision Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 44:53.

2.	Nothing in this act shall prevent the school district from appropriating funds in addition to those provided from other sources.
