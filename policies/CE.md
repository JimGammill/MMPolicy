The Superintendent may establish such permanent or temporary councils and committees as deemed necessary for assuring staff participation in decision making, for implementing policies and regulations and for the improvement of the educational program.

Functioning in an advisory capacity all councils and committees created by the Superintendent may make recommendations for submission to the School Committee through the Superintendent.  Such groups will exercise no inherent authority.  Authority for establishing policy remains with the Committee, and authority for implementing policy remains with the Superintendent.

The membership, composition, and responsibilities of administrative councils and committees will be defined by the Superintendent and may be changed at his/her discretion.  However, the School Committee wishes to be kept informed of the establishment and dissolution of these groups as well as their membership and their purpose.

Expenses incurred by such groups for consultative services, materials, and any investigative travel will be paid by the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School, but only within budgetary allotments and when approved in advance by the Superintendent.
