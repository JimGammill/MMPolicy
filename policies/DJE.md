All purchases of supplies, services, materials, equipment,  and all contracts for construction or maintenance in amounts equal to or exceeding $50,000 will be based upon competitive bidding in accordance with MGL Ch. 30B and MGL Ch. 30, section 39M.

Public notice for said procurements will require an advertisement of the Invitation to Bid be posted on the Minuteman Regional School District website and on the bulletin board in the Business Office, an advertisement in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the District, published in the Central Register, and posted on the COMMBUYS electronic procurement system administered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for not less than two weeks before bids are due.  Such advertisements shall state the time and place for submitting and opening sealed bids in response to said advertisement, and shall reserve to the District the right to reject any or all such bids.

All bids will be submitted in sealed envelopes, addressed to the Assistant Superintendent of Finance and plainly marked with the name of the bid and the time of the bid opening.  Bids will be opened in public at the time specified, and all bidders will be invited to be present.

The Assistant Superintendent of Finance, acting as the Chief Procurement Officer of the school district, reserves the right to reject any or all bids and to accept the bid that appears to be in the best interest of the District.  The Assistant Superintendent of Finance reserves the right to waive any informalities in, or reject, any or all bids or any part of any bid.  Any bid may be withdrawn prior to the scheduled time for the opening of the bids.  Any bid received after the time and date specified will not be considered.  All bids will remain firm for a period of thirty days after opening.

Upon awarding such a bid equal to or exceeding$50,000, the Superintendent and/or Assistant Superintendent of Finance will inform the School Committee.

The bidder to whom an award is made will be required to enter into a written contract with the District.  

For the procurement of construction services and contracts of $10,000 or over but less than $50,000, or as required by law, except in cases of emergency involving health or safety, the School District shall prepare a written scope of work statement to solicit written quotations from at least three vendors who customarily perform such work. Public notice for said procurements will be posted on the Minuteman Regional School District website, posted on the bulletin board in the Business Office, published in the Central Register, and posted on the COMMBUYS electronic procurement system administered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  for not less than two weeks before bids are due.  Such public notice will include the scope of work statement, and shall state the time and place for submitting and opening sealed bids in response to said public notice, and shall reserve to the District the right to reject any or all such bids and/or proposals.

On purchases and services less than $10,000, the use of written quotations should be solicited from vendors whenever feasible or when it can be anticipated that cost savings will result using sound business practices.
