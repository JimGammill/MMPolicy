The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District is a body politic and corporate with all the powers and duties conferred by law on School Committees. M.G.L c. 258, sec 13 authorizes a city or town which has accepted that section, subject to appropriation, to indemnify each member of the Minuteman School Committee for expenses or damages incurred in the defense of settlement of a claim against him/her in an amount not to exceed one million dollars providing that claim arose while such member was acting within the scope of his/her official duties and to provide funds therefore.

The district may appropriate such sums as may be necessary to purchase insurance providing indemnity to the extent that it deems appropriate, to cover costs of indemnification for any of the foregoing official or officers. 

The Superintendent shall be responsible for insuring that all Errors and Omissions policies are continuously in force, and that all School Committee members are fully insured in an amount not to exceed one million dollars, as described above.
