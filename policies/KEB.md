Complaints about school personnel will be investigated fully and fairly. However, before any such complaint is investigated, the complainant must submit the complaint in writing. 

Whenever a complaint is made directly to the School Committee as a whole or to a Committee member as an individual, it will be referred to the Superintendent for study and possible solution.  
 
The Superintendent will develop, for approval by the Committee, procedures that assure prompt and fair attention to complaints against school personnel. The procedures will require that an employee who is the object of a complaint be informed promptly and be afforded the opportunity to present the facts as he/she sees them.  If the complaint is anonymous, the Superintendent will investigate the complaint and report to the School Committee.  If an anonymous complaint is about the Superintendent, the School Committee Chairperson will investigate the complaint and report to the School Committee.
 
If it appears necessary, the administration, the person who made the complaint, or the employee involved may request an executive session of the Committee for a formal hearing and decision. Statutory restrictions on executive sessions will be observed.
