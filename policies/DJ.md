The Minuteman Regional School Committee declares its intention to purchase competitively, without prejudice, and to seek maximum educational value for every dollar expended.

All contracts for the procurement by the School District of supplies and services other than employee agreements with District employees and other than real estate, are subject to M.G.L. c. 30B and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L.c. 30B as amended from time to time.  Experience has shown that advertising for bids on low-value purchases results in unnecessary delays and additional costs to the District.  Inflationary trends warrant periodic review to determine appropriate procedures for procurement.


**SUPPLIES AND SERVICES**   
The Assistant Superintendent of Finance, acting in the capacity of Chief Procurement Officer will carry out the necessary duties for the District relevant to the acquisition of supplies and services.  The Chief Procurement Officer will be guided by the provisions of Chapter 30B of the Massachusetts General Laws, the specific directions of the District Committee, and all other applicable state laws and regulations pertinent to executing his/her duties.

Pursuant to M.G.L.c. 30B, as currently in effect, unless otherwise provided by special law, no contract for the procurement of supplies or of a service, the actual or estimated cost of which is $50,000 or more, except in cases of special emergency involving the health or safety of the people or their property and as permitted by 30B, shall be awarded unless bids or proposals for the same have been posted on the Minuteman Regional School District website, invited by advertisement in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the District, and posted on the COMMBUYS electronic procurement system  administered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  for not less than two weeks before bids are due, with  said publications to be in accordance with the applicable provisions of c. 30B, including Section 5.  Such advertisements shall state the time and place for submitting and opening sealed bids or proposals in response to said advertisement, and shall reserve to the District the right to reject any or all such bids and/or proposals.  No procurement shall be split or divided for the purpose of evading any provisions of Ch. 30B. 

For the procurement of supplies or services of $10,000 or over but less than  $50,000, or as required by law, except in cases of emergency involving health or safety, the School District shall prepare a written purchase description or scope of services and solicit written quotations from at least three vendors.  

On purchases and services less than $10,000, the use of written quotations should be solicited from vendors whenever feasible or when it can be anticipated that cost savings will result using sound business practices.


**GRANT-FUNDED EXPENSES**   
All grant-funded procurements must comply with the grant terms and conditions.  Federal funds must be administered in a manner consistent with the cost principles contained within Education Department General Administrative Regulations and 2 CFR Part 200 for Federal awards. 

Subrecipients of federal grant funds must follow both state and local procurement rules. State and local procurement rules are often stricter than federal requirements. Accordingly, the dollar amount limits in MA General Laws Chapter 30 B apply to procurement process using federal grant awards.

**Federal Procurement System Standards**   
The following standards will be used in the procurement of goods and services using federal grant funds:

**Avoiding Acquisition of Unnecessary or Duplicative Items**   
The District must avoid the acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration will be  given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase.  Where appropriate, the Business Office must make an analysis of lease versus purchase alternatives to determine the most economical approach.  

**Use of Intergovernmental Agreements**   
To foster greater economy and efficiency, the District enters into state and local intergovernmental agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of common or shared goods and services. 

**Use of Federal Excess and Surplus Property**    
The District considers the use of federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs. 

**Debarment and Suspension**   
The District awards contracts only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources. 

The District may not subcontract with or award subgrants to any debarred or suspended  person or company. 

**REAL PROPERTY**    
The School Districtâ€™s power to acquire, sell, lease, or rent real property is governed by M.G.L. Ch.30B, Sec. 16 and M.G.L. Ch. 71, Sect.16 (q) and (r), and the District shall comply with the procedures described in M.G.L. Ch.30B, Sec. 16.The power to enter into leasespurchase and sales agreements, and other agreements as to acquisition of interests in real property is vested in the District School Committee rather than the Chief Procurement Officer.  The District School Committee may make formal delegations of that power from time to time, to the extent permitted by law.      

In the event that there is any conflict between this Policy and any provision of Ch. 30B, the terms of Ch. 30B shall control.
