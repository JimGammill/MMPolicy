The following are options for excess money left in the Senior Class Treasury:

1.	The class may vote to donate the money to the general student activities fund.

2.	The class may vote to withdraw the excess money, elect a treasurer, and hold the money in a separate account independent of the school.
	
3.	The class may vote to purchase a class gift for the school.

4.	The class may vote to establish a student scholarship fund, separate and apart from all other scholarship funds.
	
5.	The class may vote to combine any of the above.
	
6.	If the class does not choose one of the above options prior to the date in which the class in question graduates, the money reverts to the remaining student activities funds.

The senior class will be notified in September at the beginning of their senior year of the above options.
