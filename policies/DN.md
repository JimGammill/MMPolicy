The Assistant Superintendent of Finance, acting in the capacity of Chief Procurement Officer will carry out the necessary duties for the District relevant to the disposition of all school property, other than real property. The Chief Procurement Officer will be guided by the provisions of Chapter 30B of the Massachusetts General Laws, the specific directions of the District School Committee, and all other applicable state laws and regulations pertinent to executing his/her duties.

The power to enter into leases, purchase and sales agreements, and other agreements as to the disposition of interests in real property is vested in the District School Committee rather than the Chief Procurement Officer. The District School Committee may make formal delegations of this power from time to time, to the extent permitted by law.

**Disposal of Surplus Equipment**   
For  disposal of equipment, the School Committee, by a majority vote, shall determine whether said equipment is surplus.  The procedure for disposal is listed below.

**Procedure**    
At a minimum, the District will publish in a newspaper with general circulation within the District a notice of public auction or online auction of surplus equipment.  The notification will be published no less than two weeks prior to the auction, and provide a website to access details that shall indicate the surplus equipment offered for sale, designate the location and method or website for inspection of such equipment, state the terms and conditions of sale, including the place, date, and time for the bid opening or auction, and state that the governmental body retains the right to reject any and all bids.

The Chief Procurement Officer will award the bid to the highest responsive and responsible bidder.  The Chief Procurement Officer shall report each transaction to the School Committee, when it occurs. The Chief Procurement Officer may also choose to offer surplus property to other member district towns and school districts.  The ability to offer surplus property to other governmental units is  not subject to the surplus supply disposal procedures of Ch. 30B.

**Real Property**    
The School Districtâ€™s power to dispose of real property is governed by M.G.L Ch. 30B Sec.16
and M.G.L Ch. 71 Sec. 16 (q) and (r),  and the District shall comply with the procedures described in M.G.L Ch. 30 B, Sec. 16. The power to enter into leases, purchase and sales
agreements, and other agreements as to the disposition of interests in real property is vested in the District School Committee rather than the Chief Procurement Officer. The District School Committee may make formal delegations of that power from time to time, to the extent permitted by law.
