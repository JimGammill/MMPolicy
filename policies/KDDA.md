Every effort will be made to assist the press and other communications media to obtain complete and adequate coverage of the programs, problems, planning, and activities of the school.		

All representatives of the media will have equal access to information about the school, but must conduct their business in a way that does not disturb the educational process.  General releases of interest to the entire community will be made available to all the media simultaneously.

In order that school system publicity is given wide coverage and is coordinated into a common effort and purpose, the following procedures will be followed in giving official information to the news media:		

1.  The School Committee Chair will be the official spokesman for the Committee, except as this duty is delegated to the Superintendent.		
2.  News releases that are of a school-wide or a sensitive nature or pertain to established committee policy are the responsibility of the Superintendent.				
3.  All statements made to the press by other staff members of the school must be cleared with the Principal and approved by the Superintendent.		

While it is impossible to know how news releases will be treated by the press, every possible effort should be made to obtain coverage of school activities that will create and maintain a dignified and professionally responsible image for the school district.
