The business of a School Committee is conducted at its official meetings.  Selection to serve as a member of the School Committee confers no privilege or authority on the members, except to attend meetings of the Committee, to propose action, to debate all proposals, and to vote. The School Committee has all powers and duties as defined by Massachusetts General Law.  It is only at a duly called and advertised meeting that its members can act as a Committee or exercise any of their powers.  The Chairperson is the spokesperson for the School Committee.

All aspects of School Committee meetings, including notice, maintenance and publication of minutes, meeting in open or executive session, and the proper modes of School Committee deliberation and decision-making, are governed by the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law, M.G.L. c. 30A, §§ 18-25.  The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office has the statutory authority to enforce the provisions of the Open Meeting Law.

The School Committee meetings will be conducted according to the Open Meeting Law.  Proper notice will be provided of School Committee meetings and proposed agenda items.  All School Committee meetings shall be open to the public and the press, unless the School Committee votes to convene in executive session for a reason permitted by the Open Meeting Law.  Minutes of all School Committee meetings will be made, kept and disseminated as required by School Committee policy and state law.

All School Committee members will comply with the provisions of the law and the guidance and decisions of the Attorney General’s Office with regard to their communications with other members of the School Committee so that all deliberations of the School Committee take place during School Committee meetings. 

Members of the School Committee shall comply with the requirements of the standards of conduct imposed by the state Conflict of Interest Law, M.G.L. c. 268A, Section 23 (c)(2), and shall not improperly disclose materials or data within the exemptions to the definition of public records as defined by section seven of chapter four of the Massachusetts General Laws, which materials or data were acquired in the course of the Committee member’s official duties, including but not limited to materials and information related to executive sessions of School Committee meetings.    

Between meetings, the Superintendent is the highest authority in the school district, but is obliged to act in conformity with polices established by the Committee. Everything the Committee does is accomplished in its meetings. Therefore, the manner in which meetings are conducted and action taken at meetings are of utmost importance.  If meetings are carried on in an efficient, orderly manner, this will do much to gain the confidence of the public and school personnel.
