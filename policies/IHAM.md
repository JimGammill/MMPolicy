The Minuteman Regional School District offers Health Education as required.  In accordance with Chapter 71, Section 32A of the General Laws of Massachusetts, a parent or guardian may exempt their child from participating in curriculum activities that involve human sexual education or human sexuality issues.  This policy affords parents or guardians the flexibility to exempt their child from any portion of said curriculum through the written notification to the Assistant-Superintendent/Principal.  No child so exempted shall be penalized by reason of such exemption.

Program materials shall be made accessible to parents and guardians through the office of the Assistant Superintendent/Principal.
