The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee expects that proper attention will be paid to the safety of students, staff and visitors on school property during the normal school day, during their participation in school sponsored extra-curricular activities on school grounds and at school sponsored functions scheduled away from school property.

The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee has the responsibility to provide safe circumstances for students and staff, and has directed the Superintendent to develop and maintain the Minuteman School Safety Crisis Management Plan to address all aspects of safety including:  disasters, safety drills, bomb threats, weather-related emergencies, overnight trips and school closings and cancellations.

The Minuteman School Safety Crisis Management Plan shall focus on three major components: prevention, intervention and aftervention.

The Minuteman School Safety Crisis Management Plan shall become the focus for regular staff training in crisis planning and response and shall be reviewed annually by the Superintendent.  The School Committee shall receive an annual report from the Superintendent on the implementation of the Plan.

The Superintendent shall assign the Minuteman staff to participate in the development of the initial Plan and shall assign staff where needed to properly and safely implement the Plan.
