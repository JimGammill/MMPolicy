It will be the responsibility of the Superintendent or his/her designee to see that the regulations developed to implement Committee policies and administer the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District are appropriately coded and included as regulations in the School Committeeâ€™s policy manual.

A regulation concerning a particular group or groups in the school will be distributed to the group(s) prior to the effective date of the regulation.
