Physical Education shall be taught for the purpose of promoting the physical well being of students.  No student shall be required to take part in physical education exercises if a licensed physician certifies in writing that in his/her opinion such physical education exercises would be injurious to the student.

The school shall attempt to meet the needs and interests of the diversity of students who attend the school, and shall ensure that during physical education classes all students are able to participate.
