The School Committee recognizes that fiscal and related resources are the foundation of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District program.  The quantity and quality of the learning programs are directly dependent on the effective and efficient management of allocated funds.  The goals of the School can best be achieved by the exercise of diligent fiscal management.

As trustee of local, state, and federal funds allocated for use in public education, the Committee will fulfill its responsibility to see that these funds are used wisely for achievement of the purposes to which they are allocated.
