#### Fire Prevention and Fire Drills

The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District will cooperate with the fire department in maintaining fire-safe conditions within all school buildings and in regularly conducting fire drills for the protection of students and staff.

The Superintendent and the Principal with the assistance of the Facilities Manager have the responsibility for periodic inspection of every room, corridor, and space in the school.  The purposes of these inspections are:

1.	To remove any fire hazards.

2.	To ensure that flammable supplies and materials are properly stored.

3.	To check the condition and proper location of all fire extinguishers and alarms.

4.	To ensure that there is no obstruction in any corridor or stairway.

Instructions for fire drills will be printed in the teachers’ and students’ handbooks.  Instructions with regard to the primary and secondary exit routes will be posted in a prominent place near the door of every room.  During the fire drill all teachers and students shall vacate the buildings in an orderly manner by means of designated fire exits to places of safety on the grounds outside the buildings.  Attendance shall be taken by each teacher upon reaching the assembly points.

In the event of fire, drill procedures should be followed.  Teachers and administrators must act in such manner to maintain order and prevent panic.

All students who are transported by bus shall have two emergency evacuation drills from the School bus each year.  These drills shall be conducted on the School grounds; the first one during the first month of school and the second one during the spring.  Each drill shall include instruction in the location of emergency exits and the actual use of all exits to evacuate the bus.
