It is the intention of the School Committee to collaborate with the School Council and the Principal in developing a schedule for the approval of the school handbook.  Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 37H directs that, â€œin each school building containing the grades nine to twelve, inclusive, the Principal, in consultation with the School Council, shall prepare and distribute to each student a handbook setting forth the rules pertaining to conduct of students.  The Student Handbook shall be available for School Committee review by March 31 to consider changes in the disciplinary policy to take effect in the following September.
 
It is essential that the contents of all handbooks conform to School Committee policies.  It is also important that all handbooks bearing the name of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School be of a quality that reflects credit on the school department.  The Superintendent will recommend to the School Committee handbooks requiring approval prior to publication.

The Superintendent will use his/her judgment as to whether other specific handbooks need Committee approval; however, all handbooks published will be made available to the Committee for informational purposes.
