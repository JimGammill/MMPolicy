In an effort to keep its written policies up to date so that they can be used consistently as a basis for School Committee action and administrative decision, the Committee will review its policies on a regular basis.  

The Committee will evaluate how the policies have been executed by the school staff and will weigh the results.  It will rely on the school staff, students, and the community for providing evidence of the effect of the policies it has adopted.

All policies will be placed on the School Committee agenda for reconsideration five years following the date the policy was adopted, unless the Superintendent recommends or the School Committee approves an earlier date for reconsideration.

The Superintendent is given the continuing commission of calling to the Committee's attention all policies that are out of date or for other reasons appear to need revision.

The School Committee directs the Superintendent to periodically recall all policy and regulations manuals for administrative updating and Committee review.
