Consultants are to be used at Minuteman only when two conditions exist.

1.	A specific need is identified.
2.	This need cannot be fulfilled by the districtâ€™s own staff.

Some legitimate examples for the use of consultants could include, but not be limited to, the following:

* Conducting in-service workshops for curriculum instructional procedures, teaching strategies, methodologies, special needs, etc.

* Curriculum development for unique courses that Minuteman should be offering.  

* Related research regarding the abilities of our students, and activities that need to be performed.

* Evaluation studies of the school, instructional program, regional efforts, external grants, etc.

* Assistance in the development of such various components of the educational process as the gathering of baseline data, assessment system, reporting system, evaluation of students, etc.

* Assistance in computer applications and programming needs.

Use of consultants must be approved by the Superintendent within existing budget or grant limitations unless permission is granted by the School Committee for consultant work to be funded by special transfer or appropriation of funds. The administrator supervising the work of any consultant is to provide the School Committee with a report on final accomplishments. Interim progress reports would also be desirable on any major projects.
