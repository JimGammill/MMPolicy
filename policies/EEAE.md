The safety and welfare of student riders will be the first consideration in all matters pertaining to transportation.  The School District reserves the right to use video surveillance and recording equipment on all buses.  The Superintendent will ensure the following conditions in the provision of transportation services to students:

1.	Students must follow established procedures for changing their boarding or unloading bus stop or for transferring from one bus to another.

2.	Students will be instructed as to the proper procedure for boarding and exiting from a school bus and in proper and safe conduct while aboard.

3.	Emergency evacuation drills will be conducted at least twice a year to acquaint student riders with procedures in emergency situations.

4.	All vehicles used to transport students will be inspected periodically for conformance with state and federal safety requirements.
