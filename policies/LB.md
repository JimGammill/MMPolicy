The School Committee will cooperate with other schools and with local, state, and regional agencies and organizations to:	

1.  Seek solutions to educational problems of common concern.		
2.  Offer support services of high quality to all learners.		
3.  Acquire federal, state, and appropriate private grants.		
4.  Promote local school system involvement in regional, state and federal decision-making.		

This cooperation may extend to research, coordination of curriculum, implementation of joint programs, exchange of information and data, and the coordination of school calendars and activities.		

Before joining any cooperative programs, education collaborative, or participating in any joint educational services with other school systems, the School Committee wants to be sure that in all instances the best interests of our students will be served and that the relationship supports the mission of the district.  In carrying out this policy the Superintendent will include in reports to the Committee an assessment of the desirability and feasibility of cooperation with other schools and agencies on matters of mutual potential interest.
