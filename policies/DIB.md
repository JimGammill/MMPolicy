**Definition**    
Revolving Fund Accounts  are accounts established for specific purposes as allowed by statute.  Generally the revenue generated for these funds is derived from fees charged for a non-mandated service or activity.  

**Management**    
Minuteman Regional High School manages revolving funds consistent with the purpose of each fund, and revenues and expenditures are applied to the funds.  All revenue received and expenditures from these funds must be specifically related to the purpose for which the fund was established.  Any money left in the fund at the end of the year carries forward into the next year,  and the fund remains open until the revenue generating activity ceases to exist, or is closed out  to the undesignated fund balance, based on the accounting requirements of the enabling legislation of each revolving fund.

All revolving funds are required to end the fiscal year in a positive fund balance position.  To the extent that a revolving fund at fiscal year-end has a deficit fund balance, said deficit amount will reduce the undesignated fund balance.   The amount of the deficit will be applied as a reduction to the Excess and Deficiency fund balance as of the date of the annual certification of the Excess and Deficiency account by MA Department of Revenue.  

**School Committee Approval**  
While the budgets for these funds are not subject to the annual adoption/approval process required by general fund budgets, a summary of the revolving fund budget by fund will be presented to the School Committee prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, and acceptance of the revolving fund budget will require a majority vote of the School Committee.  It is the responsibility of the School Committee, or an appointed subcommittee, to require a review of the Revolving Funds periodically.
