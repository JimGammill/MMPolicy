Pregnant students are protected under Title IX of federal law and are permitted to remain in regular classes and participate in extracurricular activities with non-pregnant students throughout their pregnancy, and after giving birth they are permitted to return to the same academic, vocational and extracurricular program(s) as before the leave.
Minuteman Regional High School Student Handbook 2007-2008

It is the expectation and the understanding of administrators and faculty that pregnant students will stay in school and fully participate in academic and vocational classes and extracurricular activities, unless deemed inappropriate and unsafe by a physician. Students are only allowed to be out of school and tutored at home at the express direction of their physician. Vocational program environments and/or specific tasks, if considered inadvisable for a pregnant student, may be waived for the period of time necessary, and alternative assignments given. Pregnant students are entitled to accommodations necessary to allow them to progress in the educational curriculum while providing for a safe, secure and healthy pregnancy. Accommodations, if recommended by a doctor and approved by the Principal, may include, among others:

- Door-to-door transportation to and from school.
- Change in schedule to start later in the morning or leave earlier in the day.
- Permanent bathroom pass.
- Supplemental, at-home or hospitalized tutoring.

**Parenting Students**

After the birth of the child, should any extended leave of absence from school be needed for either a new mother or father, a doctor’s letter of advisement and support would be required. Homebound and hospitalized instruction may then be provided where a student has given birth, and where a physician has certified that homebound or hospitalized instruction is in the new mother’s best interest, and should continue for a specified, but limited period of time. Such specified, but limited instruction is allowed for either the new mother or father and can be at the student’s home or another mutually convenient place (Minuteman itself, local library, community center, etc.) and must address the following criteria:

- Absence must be at least three weeks’ duration.
- Such instruction shall begin no later than two weeks from the first day of absence.
- Such instruction shall be provided at least at least two hours per day or ten hours per week for students in grades nine through twelve (this amount may be decreased or adjusted by Guidance and/or Special Education Director).
- Students unable or unwilling to fulfill the criteria for outside instruction may seek to temporarily withdraw from school to attend to their new parental duties and return to Minuteman the following September to repeat the grade level without receiving a failing grade for the classes not completed.

**Services for Pregnant and Parenting Teens at Minuteman School Nurse’s Office**

- Make available all avenues of referral legally open to students, including such agencies as may counsel a student about whether to proceed with a pregnancy.
- Apprise students of need to document court and/or clinic absences. Process documentation with the Principal.
- Communicate the need for home tutoring to the Guidance Office.
- Provide information and referral for teen parents to childcare services and voucher agencies.
- Student calls to agencies that assist in decision-making MUST be made on their own time.

**Guidance Counselors**
- Monitor student for all issues for grades, attendance, credits and graduation requirements.
- Maintain information regarding childcare resources, and advise, direct and support teen parents if issues arise.
- Support pregnant and parenting students in their efforts to successfully complete high school.
- Refer student to GED programs and testing, if they decide they cannot stay at or return to Minuteman full time.
- Absolutely no “decisional counseling” on the part of a Guidance Counselor.

**Social Worker**
- Continue to see current students from among this population, keeping in mind the complications of their pregnancy /parenting.
- Remain open to crisis counseling as may be needed by this population, in light of the discontinuation of other services.
- Support students in their efforts to successfully handle the demands of school and parenthood.
- Communicate with guidance counselors about their teen parents.
- Absolutely no “decisional counseling” on the part of the Social Worker.

The School Nurse is legally able to provide information about rights made available to teens by Federal and State Statute. 

School Counselors: Due to perceived influence on student decision making, you may not counsel on pregnancy decisions.
