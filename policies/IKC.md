Minuteman Regional Vocational High School maintains a GPA calculation based on a 4.0 point scale. The superintendent will periodically review the procedures for calculating GPA, determining Honor Roll or Academic Honors qualifications, and selecting the Valedictorian and Salutatorian of the senior class.  These procedures will be available in the Student/Parent Handbook.
