The Committee, upon the election of a candidate or upon reelection of the incumbent Superintendent, will enter into a written contract with the Superintendent which will meet the requirements of law and will protect the rights of both the Committee and the Superintendent.

**Note:  Under the laws of the Commonwealth, the School Committee may award a contract to a Superintendent of schools for a period not to exceed six years.**
