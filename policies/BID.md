The members of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee serve without compensation.

No funds held or to be held by the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District, appropriated or by reimbursement, will be paid or disbursed for the services of any School Committee member other than for approved expenses in the performance of School Committee duties.

All *approved* district expenses are processed using a purchase order system, with prior approval required, to prevent overspending.  Like all other expenses, those for Committee travel must stay within the budgeted amount and must be checked against the remaining amount in  the line item using an approval process. 

**Effective February 8, 2011**  
Committee members may be reimbursed, or partially reimbursed, for the following expenses:  
  * Travel to in-district School Committee meetings or meetings of subcommittees to which the member has been appointed.  
  * Pre-approved out-of-district in-state travel to conferences and meetings.

For a Committee member to be reimbursed, s/he must:  
  * Obtain prior approval from the Chairperson of the School Committee.  Reimbursement for out-of-state travel shall require the additional approval of the School Committee.  
  * Follow all reimbursement procedures outlined by the Business Office. (Procedures and forms will be provided by the Business Office upon request.)

As part of the normal budgeting process, the School Committee will vote on a line item for “School Committee Reimbursable Expenses.”  The Chair of the School Committee will use his/her judgment as to which School Committee member expenses should be reimbursed and will consult with the Business Office before approving any expense.  In no event will the Chair of the School Committee approve reimbursements that exceed the amount remaining in this account.  If this fund is depleted, then the School Committee may vote to transfer additional funds in to this account, when both appropriate and financially prudent.

Reimbursement for out-of-state travel requires the approval of the School Committee;  see BIB/BIBA
