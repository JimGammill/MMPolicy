Monies collected by school employees and by student treasurers shall be handled with good and prudent business procedures.  All monies collected shall be receipted, accounted for, and directed without delay to the proper location of deposit.

In no case shall monies be left overnight in the school, except in locked areas provided for safekeeping of valuables.  The school shall provide for making bank deposits after regular banking hours in order to avoid leaving money in school overnight.

Such coverage will include a commercial blanket bond covering employee dishonesty and may include a comprehensive dishonesty, disappearance and destruction bond with option coverage depending upon the exposures at various locations.
