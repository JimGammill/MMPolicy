The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee, through the Superintendent of Schools, accepts ultimate responsibility for all facets of school operations and programs.  Its chief responsibility is accomplishment of the goals and objectives it sets forth, subject to the financial support of the member towns and the financial subsidies provided by the Commonwealth.  

Because it is accountable to residents of the district, the School Committee will maintain an accountability system that conforms to state and federal regulations and that will assist the School Committee, administration, parents and public to assess the effectiveness and monitor the improvement of the school.  

Every effort will be made by the School Committee, Superintendent and staff to fulfill the responsibilities inherent in the concept of accountability.
