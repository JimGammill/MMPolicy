To promote mutual respect and understanding between the student body and the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee, students are welcome to attend at School Committee meetings and are granted privileges in speaking in line with those of the general public.

The members of the student advisory committees shall, by majority vote prior to the first day of June in each year, elect from their number a chairperson who shall serve for a term of one year. The chairperson of the Student Advisory Committee shall be an ex-officio, nonvoting member of the School Committee, without the right to attend executive sessions unless such right is expressly granted by the School Committee. Said chairperson shall be subject to all School Committee rules and regulations and shall serve without compensation.
