Purchasing procedures will be designed to ensure the best possible price for the desired products and services.

Procedures for purchasing will be developed by the Superintendent.  These procedures will require that all purchases are made on a properly approved purchase order, and that for items not put to bid, price quotations will be solicited as required by M.G.L. Chapter 30B.

Special arrangements may be made for ordering perishable and emergency supplies.

To authorize bills for payment, a warrant must be prepared.  This warrant must be signed by the Warrant Subcommittee or a majority of the School Committee prior to being sent to the District Treasurer for processing of payment.

School purchases will be made only on official approved purchase orders, with such exceptions as may be made for emergency purchases and those made with petty cash funds.
