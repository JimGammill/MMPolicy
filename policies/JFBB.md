The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee shall vote annually no later than May 1 whether to accept students under the School Choice program.  The district shall only accept school choice students if their acceptance will not force the creation of additional programs at the expense of existing programs, will not cause the member towns to subsidize the school choice students, and in general only if the school choice students will fill empty seats in already existing programs.  The School Committee will carefully consider whether the acceptance of school choice students will have a negative impact on future class sizes as well.
