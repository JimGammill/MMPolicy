The Minuteman School Committee will periodically establish realistic objectives related to Committee procedures and relationships.  At the end of a specified length of time, the Committee will measure its performance against the stated objectives.

The following areas of School Committee operations and relationships are representative of those in which objectives may be set and progress appraised:

1.	Communication with the public

2.	School Committee – Superintendent relationships

3.	School Committee member development and performance

4.	Policy development 

5.	Educational leadership

6.	Fiscal management

7.	School Committee meetings

8.	Performance of subcommittees of the School Committee

9.	Interagency and governmental relationships

When the Committee has completed its self-evaluation, the members will discuss the results in detail and formulate a new series of objectives.  At the same time, the Committee will set an approximate date on which the next evaluation will be conducted.

Implied in the concept of evaluation is an assumption that individuals and Committees are capable of improvement.  The School Committee believes that its performance will be improved if evaluation is carried out systematically in accordance with good planning, conscientious follow-through, and careful assessment of results.
