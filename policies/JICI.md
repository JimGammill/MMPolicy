The possession of a dangerous weapon on school property or at any school event or activity is strictly prohibited, except for law enforcement officials who are exercising their professional responsibilities. For purposes of this policy and the Student / Parent Handbook, the term “dangerous weapon” is defined according to state law, Chapter 269, Section 10, and includes, but is not limited to: any and all firearms, any stiletto, dagger or a device or case which enables a knife with a locking blade to be drawn at a locked position, any ballistic knife, or any knife with a detachable blade capable of being propelled by any mechanism, dirk knife, any knife having a double-edged blade, or a switch knife, or any knife having an automatic spring release device by which the blade is released from the handle, having a blade of over one and one-half inches, or a sling shot, blowgun, blackjack, metallic knuckles or knuckles of any substance which could be put to the same use with the same or similar effect as metallic knuckles, nunchaku, zoobow, also known as klackers or kung fu sticks, or any similar weapon consisting of two sticks of wood, plastic or metal connected at one end by a length of rope, chain, wire or leather, a shuriken or any similar pointed starlike object intended to injure a person when thrown, or any armband made with leather which has metallic spikes, points or studs, or any similar device made from any other substance or a cestus or similar material weighted with metal or other substance and worn on the hand, or a manrikigusari or similar length of chain having weighted ends, and any other object capable of inflicting bodily harm. A dangerous weapon also could be handmade and includes a wide range of objects: any type of knife: pocket knife, kitchen knife, hunting knife, or any other cutting object; pipe or club; acid; explo¬sives, guns, including a pellet gun or BB gun; live ammunition or other dangerous objects, including laser pointers.  The law also recognizes that many objects commonly found in schools (such as a geometry compass, a baseball bat, or a student’s boot) could be used as a weapon.  If an object is used to threaten, intimidate, or assault a person in any way, the object would be considered a dangerous weapon.
