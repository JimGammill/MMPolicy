The Superintendent or his/her designee will seek to develop as complete a substitute list as possible so that the instructional program can be effectively carried on in event of the absences of regular classroom teachers.

The consideration of assignment of a substitute will include experience, subject matter, interests, and ability to supervise groups of students.
