Regular meetings of the Committee shall be held at least monthly at the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School at 7:00 p.m. or as may from time to time be determined by vote of the Committee, provided that notice of any change in the date, time or place of regular meetings shall be communicated by the Secretary to any members of the Committee who may have been absent from the meeting at which such change was made. All meetings shall be posted in accordance with the Open Meeting Law (so called). 6/7/88, 5/23/88, (08)

Except in an emergency, a notice of every meeting of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee shall be filed with the clerk of the city or town of each member community, and the notice or a copy thereof shall, at least forty-eight hours, including Saturdays but not Sundays and legal holidays, prior to such meeting, be publicly posted in the office of the clerk or on the principal official bulletin board of such city or town. The secretary of the School Committee shall file the notice of meetings of the committee with the clerk of each city or town within the district and post the notice in his/her office or on the principal official bulletin board of the city or town and the secretary shall post such notice in his/her office or on the principal official bulletin board of the district. The notice shall be printed in easily readable type and shall contain the date, time and place of such meeting. 

The general public will be notified through local media of the cancellation of any meeting due to weather conditions or any unforeseen circumstances.  Attempts will be made to call all members by telephone.

The Chairperson may, if he/she deems it expedient, and shall, upon written request of three members of the Committee, call a special meeting of the Committee. The notice of a special meeting shall be in writing, shall state the time, place, and purpose of the meeting and shall be posted and given to each member of the Committee either by delivering a copy thereof to such member in hand or by leaving the same at his/her home address at least twenty-four hours before the time of the meeting or by mailing postage prepaid a copy thereof addressed to the member at his/her business or home address not later than forty-eight hours (exclusive of Sundays and legal holidays) preceding the day on which such special meeting is to be held. At such special meeting no business shall be considered other than that designated in the notice. 5/23/88

The agenda for special meetings is restricted to only such business that appears in the call of the meeting unless words such as the following are included in the call:  "and such other business as may properly come before it." 

If any member of the School Committee is not properly notified about a special meeting, the legality of any action taken could be subject to challenge.

The law provides that if a special meeting is called because of an emergency, public notice need not be given.  "Emergency" is defined as "a situation where immediate, undelayed action is deemed by the board to be imperative."

All special meetings are open to the public and press unless they are to go into executive session.

All procedures and rules for the conduct of special meetings shall be the same as those used in the regular meetings.

The general public will be notified through local media of the cancellation of any meeting due to weather conditions or any unforeseen circumstances.  Attempts will be made to call all members by telephone.
