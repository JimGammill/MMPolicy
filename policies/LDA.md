The Committee encourages the administration to cooperate with teacher-training institutions in the placement of student teachers in the school system. All initial arrangements with the colleges and universities will be subject to the Superintendentâ€™s approval.		

The Committee authorizes the Superintendent or his or her designee to honor the reasonable rules and training guidelines of the sending institution.		

In all arrangements made with colleges and universities, the school system will be given the privilege of interviewing and accepting or rejecting individual candidates for student teaching and internships. CORI checks will be completed prior to any student teacher or intern commencing an on-site program.		

The Superintendent will create and implement procedures to evaluate the performance of student teachers and interns to ensure that they comply with the expectations and standards of the school.  The Superintendent reserves the right to terminate the student teaching or internship of any student.
