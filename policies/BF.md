The School Committee, as a decision making body, is confronted with a continuing flow of problems, issues, and needs which require action.  While the Committee is determined to expedite its business, it is also mindful of the importance of planning, brainstorming, and thoughtful discussion without action.  

Workshops will be conducted for the purpose of informal discussions and exploration of matters pertaining to the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District.  Topics for discussion and study will be announced publicly.  All workshops will be conducted in accordance with the Open Meeting Law.  No formal votes will be taken at these workshops.

All workshops are open to the public.
