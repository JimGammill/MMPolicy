It is the goal of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District to provide the best service possible to our public at the best possible cost.  Losses due to accidents make achieving this goal much harder.  This statement of policy concerning safety is a reflection of the importance the School Committee places in operating in a safe manner.

The School Committee is committed to an organized program of safety management.  All Personnel are expected to do their share to ensure the success of the safety management program.  It is the responsibility of every employee to work and act in a safe manner.  

The Superintendent will appoint a Safety Officer to oversee a safety committee to assess the ongoing safety of the building and to make recommendations to improve it.
