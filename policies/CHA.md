The Superintendent will be responsible for specifying required actions and designing the detailed arrangements under which the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District will be operated in accordance with School Committee policy.  These detailed arrangements will be designed to implement policies, goals and objectives of the Committee and will be one of the means by which the school system will be governed.

In the development of regulations, the Superintendent may involve at the planning stage those who would be affected by the regulations, including staff members, students, parents, and the public.  The Superintendent must weigh with care the counsel given by representatives of staff, student and community organizations.  The Superintendent will inform the Committee of such counsel in presenting pertinent reports of regulations and in presenting regulations for Committee approval.

As long as the Superintendent operates within the guidelines of policy adopted by the Committee, regulations may be issued without prior Committee approval unless Committee action is required by law, or the Committee has specifically asked that certain types of regulations be given Committee approval, or the Superintendent recommends Committee approval in light of strong community attitudes or probable staff reactions.
