The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee will rely on its professional staff to design and implement instructional programs and courses of study that will advance the educational goals of the district.

The Superintendent will have authority to approve new programs and courses of study that have been developed in accord with Chapters 71 and 74 of the Massachusetts General Laws and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education procedures governing academic, career/technical and vocational programs. The Committee will consider, and officially adopt, new programs and courses when they constitute an extensive alteration in instructional content or approach and will approve program and curriculum annually in the Program of Studies.

The Committee will be informed of all new courses and substantive revisions in curriculum. It will receive reports regularly.
