A regional vocational technical School Committee derives its powers from provisions of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Extensive powers are granted by virtue of the interrelated provisions of three portions of the General Laws:

1.	Those laws related directly to vocational education.

2.	Those laws related directly to regional school districts.

3.	Those laws related to local School Committees.
