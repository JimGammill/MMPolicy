The purpose of this policy is to provide information and standardized procedures for persons involved in the prevention, training management and return to activity decisions regarding students who incur head injuries while involved in extracurricular athletic activities[1] including, but not limited to, interscholastic sports, in order to protect their health and safety as required by Massachusetts law and regulations.  The requirements of the law apply to all public middle and high schools, however configured, serving grades six through high school graduation.  

Minuteman has established a policy and procedures to provide concussion education for administration, faculty, athletic department staff, parents and students. This document defines procedures for staff to follow in managing head injuries, and outlines school policy as it pertains to return both to academics and to athletic play after concussion.
  	
Minuteman seeks to provide a safe return to activity for all athletes after injury, particularly after a concussion. Procedures have been developed to aid in ensuring that concussed athletes are managed appropriately. These include identification of concussed athletes, appropriate medical referral for treatment and follow-up, academic assistance, and insuring full recovery prior to return to athletic activity and full academic load.
 
In addition to any training required by law, the following persons shall complete one of the head injury safety training programs approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) as found on its website: coaches; certified athletic trainers; trainers; volunteers; school and team physicians; school nurses; athletic directors; directors responsible for a school marching band; employees or volunteers; and students who participate in an extracurricular activity and their parents.

It is the Minuteman’s policy that all students who plan to participate in school-sponsored extracurricular activities and their parents shall satisfy the following pre-participation requirements:

1.	Each year, PRIOR to the commencement of practice or competition, the student and parent shall complete the mandatory training and provide a evidence of completion;
2.	Each year, PRIOR to the commencement of practice or competition, the student and parent shall provide a signed, current pre-participation form which provides a comprehensive health history including history of concussions, head, face or cervical spine injury history.

This policy shall address sports-related head injuries occurring in extracurricular athletic activities.  It will also be applied to all head injuries that occur in school.

This policy and its procedures will be reviewed every two years after its adoption at a minimum, or more often as necessary, with affirmation sent to the DPH to include any possible revisions.

The Superintendent shall maintain or cause to be maintained complete and accurate records of the district’s compliance with the requirements of the Concussion Law, and shall maintain the following records for three years or, at a minimum, until the student graduates, unless state or federal law requires a longer retention period:

1.	Verifications of completion of annual training and receipt of materials;
2.	DPH Pre-participation forms and receipt of materials;
3.	DPH Report of Head Injury Forms, or school based equivalents;
4.	DPH Medical Clearance and Authorization Forms, or school based equivalents; and
5.	Graduated reentry plans for return to full academic and extracurricular athletic activities.

This policy also applies to volunteers who assist with extracurricular athletic activities.  Such volunteers shall not be liable for civil damages arising out of any act or omission relating to the requirements of law, unless such volunteer is willfully or intentionally negligent in their act or omission.

The Superintendent designates the Athletic Director as the person who is responsible for the implementation of the sports related concussion policy and procedures. The Athletic Director oversees the collection, by his staff, of the Minuteman Athletics Emergency Information Sheet that includes a pre-participation concussion/head injury history.  The Athletic Director shall establish a procedure for a medical or nursing review of all pre-participation forms indicating a history of head injury.

The procedures will discuss and outline what a concussion is, the mechanism of injury, signs and symptoms, management and return to play requirements, as well as information on Second Impact Syndrome and past concussion syndrome.  Lastly, these procedures will discuss the importance of education for our athletes, coaches and parents and other persons required by law.

These procedures will be reviewed on a yearly basis with all staff.  An accurate synopsis of this policy shall be placed in the student and faculty handbooks.

The Superintendent designates the school nurse as the person responsible for ensuring appropriate medical documentation of  the annual physical examination (performed within the last 13 months), as required by the MIAA. Students may not participate in any sport, including practices, without current documentation.
