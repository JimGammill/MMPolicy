Inventories are taken for a number of reasons:  to make sure that school property is being used for the purposes for which it was purchased; to protect school property from theft and damage; to assess the operational condition and efficiency of school equipment; to establish a maintenance and repair schedule; to determine the specific amounts of supplies which need to be purchased for the near future; to create (for insurance purposes) a current record of the value of school property in the case of fire loss, other damage, or theft, and to comply with state and federal regulations:

1.	There shall be an annual inventory of all equipment, furniture, and supplies that are under the responsibility and jurisdiction of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District Committee.

2.	The annual inventory shall be taken under the general supervision of the Superintendent and shall be under the direct supervision of the Business Manager with other professional and non-instructional employees cooperating as directed.

3.	The procedures for taking and valuing the annual inventory shall be established in consultation with insurers.

4.	The Superintendent will provide the School Committee with a brief report of the annual inventory
