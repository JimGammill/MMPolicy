#### Policy Intent/Rationale

The Minuteman School District promotes healthy schools, by supporting wellness, good nutrition, and regular physical activity as part of the total learning environment.  The District supports a healthy environment where children learn and participate in positive dietary and lifestyle practices.  Schools contribute to the basic health status of children by facilitating learning through the support and promotion of good nutrition and physical activity.  Improved health optimizes student performance potential and ensures that no child is left behind.

Provide a comprehensive learning environment for developing and practicing lifelong wellness behaviors.  The entire school environment, not just the classroom, shall be aligned with healthy school goals to positively influence a student's understanding, beliefs, and habits as they relate to good nutrition and regular physical activity.  A healthy school environment should not be sacrificed because of a dependence on revenue from high-added fat, high-added sugar, and low nutrient foods to support school programs.

Support and promote proper dietary habits contributing to studentsâ€™ health
status and academic performance.  All foods available on school grounds and at school-sponsored activities during the instructional day should meet or exceed the district nutrition standards.  Emphasis should be placed on foods that are nutrient dense per calorie.  To ensure high quality, nutritious meals, foods should be served with consideration toward variety, appeal, taste safety, and packaging.

Provide more opportunities for students to engage in physical activity.  A quality physical education program is an essential component for all students to learn about and participate in physical activity.  Physical activity should be included in a school's daily education program from grades 9 through 12.  Physical activity should include regular instructional physical education, in accordance with the Massachusetts Health Curriculum Framework and the National Standards for Physical Education (NASPE), as well as co-curricular activities.
