Naming an area, structure or facility is an important matter that deserves thoughtful attention.  Personal prejudice or favoritism, political pressure or temporary popularity should not be an influence in choosing a name.  The purpose of naming an area, structure or facility is to honor an individual or an organization for distinguished service or outstanding contributions to the school.

This policy outlines the procedure for naming architectural structures, outdoor facilities, academic programs and the installation of commemorative plaques on school premises.

The naming of an area, structure or facility must be placed on the School Committee agenda and voted affirmatively at two consecutive meetings.
