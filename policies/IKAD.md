The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District has adopted a policy to assist the student, parent/guardian and teacher in those unusual circumstances in which a grade change may be warranted.

The specific details regarding calculation errors, jurisdiction over grade changes, “incomplete” grades and the appeals process is found in the Student/Parent Handbook.
