The personnel policies established by the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee shall have as their primary objectives the following:

- To attract and maintain a staff which shares the goal of the School Committee to provide the highest quality of education possible for the students at the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical High School and to exert all efforts to obtain that goal.

- To provide such benefits and incentives for the staff as will enable the Committee to attract and maintain personnel who share such a commitment.

- To create an environment in which providing the highest quality of education is the primary focus of all staff.

- To create an environment which is culturally sensitive and in which all persons are treated equally and with respect and dignity at all times.

- To create an environment in which the learning process is honored. 

Among the sources that form the foundation for personnel policy are:

1.	Chapter 71 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that pertain to “teachers” as certified personnel and the requirements for Vocational Technical educators as issued by the Department  of Elementary and Secondary Education 

2.	The specific provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements.

3.	Principles of good school personnel administration as detailed in research and in the literature.

4.	Related personnel policies.
