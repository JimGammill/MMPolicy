It is the School Committee's desire that use of school property be enjoyed by the community.  It is the Committee's intent that such use will maintain safe conditions and preserve the property for school program use.  Availability of school facilities may be reduced during periods of high maintenance and usage.	

Use of school buildings and other facilities by organizations will be permitted only when an educational or civic purpose that aligns with the mission and purpose of the district will be served.  	

School facilities will be used according to the regulations and rental fee schedules recommended by the Superintendent and approved by the School Committee.		

Permission for the use of facilities must be obtained through the office of the Superintendent of Schools, where applications are available for this purpose.		

School facilities will be available for the following:		

1.  Public school activities		
2.  Parent-teacher activities		
3.  Community education offered by the school district
4.  Official town public hearings and political activities		
5.  Meetings and activities sponsored by the School Committee and school personnel		
6.  Recreational activities		
7.  Local nonprofit and noncommercial organization activities
