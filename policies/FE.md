**School Building Construction**

By agreement and by law, the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District was formed in order to construct, maintain and operate a vocational technical high school for the region.  The Regional School Committee may appoint a school building committee, or may even serve in that role itself.
 
All building construction and major renovation must be done in accordance with provisions in the law and the regulations promulgated by the Department of Public Safety of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts School Building Authority.
