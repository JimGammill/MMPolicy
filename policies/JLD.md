Guidance is defined as helping individuals understand themselves in the light of their abilities, aptitudes, interests, attitudes, strengths, and limitations.  The guidance process should assist students in the development of their potential; their decisions relating to personal, educational, and vocational matters, and also in becoming capable of mature self-guidance.

Guidance counselors and other personnel shall represent to students a broad spectrum of education and career opportunities.  School personnel shall not present race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin or sexual orientation as limiting factors in career determination.  No materials, tests, or procedures shall be employed for guidance purposes that discriminate and/or limit choices on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin or sexual orientation.

The Minuteman District’s guidance program will be based on this definition and developed from these broad fundamental principles:

1.  Individuals are different from one another in their capabilities, aptitudes, interests, 	needs, 	goals, desires and values.
2.  Conditions having a bearing on the development of a student’s potential may be 	improved. Equality of educational opportunity will benefit the individual and society.
3.  Guidance is a continuous and developmental process.  Every experience of the 	individual influences his/her performance in some way.
4.  Guidance does not propose to program an individual's course of action but rather tries 	to assist him/her in arriving at his/her own satisfactory solutions. Guidance services  are 	available to all students and will include testing and assessment, advice and assistance 	with: academic course and career and technical education program placement; individual 	student career plan development;  appropriate internship or cooperative education site 	selection;  appropriate employment and/or post-secondary education opportunity  	identification and selection; transition plan development;  course selection; study skills 	development, as well as consultation services and personal 	development guidance where 	needed. The Guidance Office will manage student grades, 	transcripts, education plans, 	appeals, and records in conformance with DESE and District rules 	and procedures 	established by the Superintendent or designee. 

The number of guidance counselors and their particular assignments will be determined by the Superintendent or designee.
