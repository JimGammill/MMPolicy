Teachers and certain other professional employees who have served in the School District for three consecutive years shall be entitled to professional teacher status. The Superintendent will base his/her decisions on the results of evaluation procedures conducted according to Committee policy.

At the end of each of the first three years of a teacher's employment, it will be the responsibility of the Superintendent to notify each employee in writing of the decision on reappointment.  Notification to a teacher not being reappointed must be made by June 15 or at an earlier date if required by a collective bargaining agreement and must include the reason for dismissal.	
	
A teacher with professional teacher status whose position is abolished by the School Committee may be continued in the employ of the school system in another position for which he/she is legally qualified.	
	
Nothing in these provisions will be considered as restricting the Superintendent from changing teaching assignments or altering or abolishing assignments except that, by law, no teacher may be assigned to a position for which he/she is not legally qualified.	

Established by law and Committee policy
