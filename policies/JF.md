#### I.	INTRODUCTION

An admission process is necessary in vocational technical schools where space is a limiting factor.  Vocational technical laboratories program majors are designed and equipped to serve a specific maximum number of students safely.  Consequently, a complex of such laboratories lacks both the space and flexibility to accommodate all applicants.  Therefore, a selection process is necessary. All applicants to grades nine through twelve at Minuteman High School will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admission Policy.  

#### II.	EQUAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY

Minuteman  Regional  Vocational  Technical  School  District  admits  students  and makes available its advantages, privileges and courses of study without regard to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, or homeless status, gender identity and expression.

If there is a student with limited English proficiency, a qualified representative from Minuteman will assist the applicant in completing the necessary forms and assist in interpreting during the entire application and admission process upon the request of the applicant.

Students with disabilities may voluntarily self-identify for the purpose of requesting reasonable accommodations during the entire application and admission process.

Information on limited English proficiency and disability submitted voluntarily by the applicant, for the purpose of receiving assistance and accommodations during the entire application and admission process, will not affect their admission to the school.

#### III.	ELIGIBILITY

Any 8th, 9th, 10th, or 11th grade student who is a resident of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District (Acton, Arlington, Belmont, Bolton, Boxborough, Carlisle, Concord, Dover, Lancaster, Lexington, Lincoln, Needham, Stow, Sudbury, Wayland, and Weston) who expects to be promoted into the grade they seek to enter by their local district is eligible to apply for fall admission or admission during the school year subject to availability of openings to Minuteman High School.  Resident students will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admission Policy.  Priority for admission is given to Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District residents according to the District Agreement.

Students who are not residents of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District are eligible to apply for fall admission subject to the availability of openings to Minuteman. Nonresident applicants must file a *Chapter 74 Vocational Technical Nonresident Student Tuition Application (located at: [www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions](https://www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions))* with the Superintendent of the student’s district of residence in accordance with the MA Department of Education Guidelines for the *Vocational Technical Education Program Nonresident Student Tuition Process* pursuant to M.G.L. c. 74. [www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions](https://www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions).  Deadline for this application to be filed with local Superintendent is April 1st.

The student’s parent/guardian or school that has been denied nonresident tuition by the district of residence may request that the Commissioner review the denial of tuition.  The request for a review of the denial shall be submitted in writing to the Commissioner within 10 business days of the receipt of the written denial from the district of residence in accordance with the *Guidelines for the Vocational Technical Education Program Nonresident Student tuition Process pursuant to M.G.L. c. 74*. M.G.L.  c.  74  Section  8A  requires  that  the  municipality  of  residence  provide transportation to students admitted to Minuteman as nonresidents under M.G.L. c.74, Sections 7 and 7C.  Nonresident students will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admission Policy.

Transfer students from other chapter 74 state-approved vocational technical education programs are eligible to apply for fall admission or admission during the school year to grades 9 through 12 at Minuteman provided they expect to be promoted into the grade they seek to enter by their current school.  Transfer students will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admission Policy.

**School Choice**    
Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District does not participate in the
School Choice Program, unless the School Committee’s annual required vote on the issue determines otherwise.

**McKinney-Vento**      
Minuteman  complies  with  federal  law  to  ensure  that  all homeless children and youths have equal access to the same free, appropriate public education as provided to other children and youth.  Minuteman has a designated staff person to serve as the Homeless Education Liaison, whose role it is to assist homeless children to enroll in school and to receive the educational services for which they are eligible, and to ensure that homeless youth participate fully in the opportunities at Minuteman without segregation or stigmatization.

**Home Schooled Students**   
Students presently being formally home schooled may apply for admissions to Minuteman, including admissions to Minuteman during the school year, provided all Admissions Policy criteria are followed.  The home schooled student’s parent or guardian must submit a copy of the Home School approval letter from the local school superintendent and, if grades are not available, a representative sample or portfolio (if available) of the student’s body of work in English, Math, Science, and Social Studies.

#### VIII.      SELECTION PROCESS

The Admission Director at Minuteman will examine, discuss and make recommendations for action on the applicants.  The Admissions Director considers scholastic achievement, attendance, school behavior, sending school’s recommendation and interview results. Applications are reviewed, processed and assigned points by grade level.

After a point total for each resident application has been determined, all resident applications are placed in order of their “point total” and town of residence. Resident applications are then accepted in order of the point total they have achieved.  The resident applicant with the highest point total is accepted first, the residents with the second highest point total is accepted second, and so on until all district-wide openings are filled.

All resident applications are accepted, declined, or placed on a waiting list.  If openings occur, the seats are then filled by accepting resident applicants from the waiting list.  These resident applicants, like those accepted earlier, are accepted in order of their place on the waiting list determined by the total points given according to the selection criteria.   The wait list is valid for the current school year.

Non-resident applications are evaluated using the criteria in this Admission Policy and will be placed on the waiting list after the resident applicants.  Non-resident applicants on the waiting list will only be accepted if all resident applicants on the waiting list have been accepted.

Applications received after April 1st will be evaluated using the same criteria as other applications and their composite score will be integrated in rank order on the established waiting list.

All applicants whose applications are received by Minuteman are notified of their   status by a letter to the parents/guardians and their local school guidance counselor within thirty days of a completed application.

#### IX:	ENROLLMENT

*In order to enroll at Minuteman for the fall, applicants must have been promoted to the grade they seek to enter by their local school district.  In addition, they must have passed courses in English language arts or the equivalent and mathematics for the school year immediately preceding their enrollment at Minuteman. Applicants failing either or both subjects  are  required  to  enroll  in  and  pass  comparable  summer  school  course(s) provided by their local school district or another school district, prior to admission into Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District.*

*Acceptance and enrollment at Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School is based upon the accuracy and completeness of a student’s application.  Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District reserves the right to revoke its acceptance of any student, at any time, if it determines that the student, the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s), or the student’s sending school district provided inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information during the application process.*

#### X.      VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL PROGRAM PLACEMENT/EXPLORATORY

All 9th graders who enroll at Minuteman High School shall participate in a half-year vocational technical exploratory program (September – January), designed to help students learn about their talents and interests relative to a variety of different vocational-technical programs.   During the exploratory period students will spend two days in each vocational/technical program and are evaluated and assessed in the following areas: attendance & punctuality conduct & discipline, conformance to safety, participation & effort, attitude & respect, quality of work and use of tool, machines, technology and facility. Students can receive a maximum of 105 points with a perfect score of 15 in each category. The total point accumulated during a shop rotation translates as follows:

Total Points Accumulated|	Earned Letter Grade|	Numerical Value Grade|  |  |  |
---|---|---|---|---|---|
90 - 105|	A	|95|  |  |  |
80 - 89|	B	|85|  |  |  |
70 – 79|	C	|75|  |  |  |
60 – 69|	C-|70|  |  |  |
30 – 59|	D	|65|  |  |  |
14 – 29|	D-|60|  |  |  |
 0 – 13|	F	|50|  |  |  |

At the end of the exploratory period, student will select their program of choice, as well as a second and third choice.  Students may be admitted into their first choice program based on the point total they received in all shops during the exploratory program. If a student’s point total in all shops combined is so low that they were not  placed in their  
second or third choice shop because the shops were filled by students with  higher  point  totals,  the student will meet the guidance counselor who will present a list of programs  that  have openings.  This  process continues until all students are placed.

If a nonresident student selects and is admitted into a program that is different than the one for which they have been approved for nonresident tuition, a new chapter 74
Vocational Technical Education Nonresident Student Tuition Application must be completed and approved for the new chapter 74 vocational technical education program in accordance with the MA Department of Elementary & Secondary Education Guidelines for the Vocational Technical Education Program Nonresident Student Tuition Process pursuant to M.G.L. c. 74: [www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions/nonres_guidelines](https://www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions/nonres_guidelines) and upon written approval of the sending district.

Students who enroll in Minuteman High School after grade 9 may explore vocational technical programs that have openings, before making a program selection.  Students are evaluated by each vocational technical teacher during the period of exploration.  If the number of enrollees seeking a particular program major exceeds the number of openings, the evaluation of the student’s rank order would determine the enrollee or enrollees who are placed in the particular program major.

Students who wish to transfer from one program major to another during the school year may apply for transfer.   Transfer requests, regardless of residency, will be considered subject to the availability of openings in the requested program.

#### XI.	REVIEW and APPEALS
