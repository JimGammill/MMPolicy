The School Committee may use the services provided by District Counsel. The Committee and the Superintendent may seek his/her services to counsel and represent the school system at various times.

However, because the complexity of School Department operations often requires specialized legal services, the Committee may also retain an attorney or law firm to provide additional legal services.

It will be the duty of the counsel for the Committee to advise the School Committee and the Superintendent on the specific legal problems submitted to him/her. He/she will attend meetings upon request and will be sufficiently familiar with Committee policies, practices, and actions under these policies, and with the requirements of school law to enable him/her to offer the necessary legal advice.

A decision to seek legal advice or assistance on behalf of the school system will be made by the Committee or the Superintendent.

Many types of legal assistance are routine and do not require specific Committee approval or prior notice. However, when the Superintendent concludes that unusual types or amounts of professional legal service may be required, he/she will advise the Committee and seek either initial or continuing authorization for such service. 

Access to legal counsel by individual School Committee members will be through the Chairperson.

The Committee shall annually appoint legal counsel to address issues determined by the Committee. See also BBA.
