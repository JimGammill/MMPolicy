The Minuteman Regional Vocation Technical School Committee values the health and safety of its students. As part of its services to students, the District may provide services related to student health.

Activities may include identification of student health needs, health screening tests (including eye and hearing screening tests), communicable disease prevention and control, promotion of the correction of remediable health defects, emergency care of the ill and injured, health counseling, health and safety education, and the maintenance of a healthful school environment.

The District recognizes that parents have the primary responsibility for the health of their students.  The school will cooperate with appropriate professional organizations associated with maintaining individual and community health and safety.

The District shall provide the services of a medical consultant who shall render medical and administrative consultative services to school district personnel responsible for school health and athletics. 

**Procedures for Emergency at School**   
School personnel shall give only emergency care to students who become ill or injured on school property, buses, or while under school supervision.

Each year parents shall supply information indicating where the student is to be taken in case of an emergency; the name, address, and phone number of a neighbor to be contacted in case the parent/guardian is not available; and any allergies or diseases the student might have.

The District shall maintain a Medical Emergency Response Plan, as required by law, and an Emergency Procedures Handbook, which shall be utilized by District personnel for handling emergencies.  Emergency procedures shall include the following:
	
- Provision for care beyond First Aid, which would enable care by the family or its 	physician or the local Emergency Medical Services agencies.  In instances when the EMS 	is required, every effort shall be made to provide the unit with the student's Emergency 	Card which lists any allergies or diseases the student might have;
	
- Provisions for reporting all accidents, cases of injury, or illness to the 	Principal.  Provisions shall be made (in all cases of injury or illness involving possible 	legal or public relations implications) for reporting such to the appropriate executive 	director of education immediately;

- Prompt reporting by teachers to the Principal or designee any accident or serious illness 	and such reports will be filed with the Business Office.

**Student Illness or Injury**   
In case of illness or injury, the parent or guardian will be contacted and asked to call for the student or provide the transportation.

Transportation of an ill or injured student is not normally to be provided by the school.  If the parent cannot provide transportation and the student is ill or injured, an ambulance may be called.  Expense incurred as a result of emergency ambulance use will not be borne by the District.

Transportation of a student by school personnel will be done only in an emergency and by the 
individual so designated by the school administrator.
