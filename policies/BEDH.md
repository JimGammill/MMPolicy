### Right to Address Meetings

Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee meetings, except for executive sessions, are open to the public.  Citizens of the district are invited to attend the meetings of the Committee.

A citizen or employee desiring a formal place on the agenda should submit such a request to the Superintendent seven days prior to the School Committee meeting, according to "Agenda Preparation and Dissemination."  (BEDB)

The Chairperson will ascertain, prior to the opening of the meeting, whether any visitor who has not requested to be on the agenda wishes to bring anything to the attention of the Committee.  Under most circumstances, the Committee will permit a brief statement at an appropriate time by any citizen requesting to be heard.

Cases of discipline, school management, instruction or administration of any sort shall come before the School Committee only when reported by the Superintendent of schools or on appeal of a pupil, parent, teacher, or other person from a decision of the Superintendent which shall be addressed to the Chairperson of the Committee.

"No person shall address a public meeting of a board without leave of the presiding officer at such meeting, and all persons shall, at the request of such presiding officer, be silent. If, after warning from the presiding officer, a person persists in disorderly behavior, said officer may order him to withdraw from the meeting, and, if he does not withdraw, may order a constable or any other person to remove him and confine him in some convenient place until the meeting is adjourned." (BEC)
