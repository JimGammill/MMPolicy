One of the primary responsibilities of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District Committee is to secure adequate funds to carry out a high-level program of education.

The annual school budget is the financial outline of the district's educational program.  The annual school budget process is an important function of the school district operations and should serve as a means to improve communications within the school organization and with the residents of the communities in the district.

Public school budgeting is regulated and controlled by statute and state regulations.  The Superintendent will be responsible for preparing and presenting the annual school budget to the Committee for adoption.

The Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent of Finance will work with the Finance Subcommittee, the District Treasurer, and others as appropriate to prepare and present the annual school budget to the Committee for adoption.
