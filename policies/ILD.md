In this policy, "surveys, analyses, or evaluations" refer to methods of gathering data for research purposes.  Without the prior written consent of the student's parent/guardian, or of the student if he/she is at least 18 years of age, no student shall be required as part of any program wholly or partially funded by the U.S. Department of Education to submit to any survey, analyses, or evaluation that reveals information concerning:

1.	Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or student's parent;
2.	Mental or psychological problems of the student or student's family;
3.	Sex behavior or attitudes;
4.	Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, or demeaning behavior;
5.	Critical appraisals of others with whom respondents have close family relationships;
6.	Legally recognized privileged relationships, such as with lawyers, doctors, or ministers;
7.	Religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or parents; or
8.	Income, other than as required by law to determine eligibility for school programs or for receiving financial assistance under such program.

All instructional materials, including teachers' manuals, films, tapes, or other supplementary material which will be used in connection with any such survey, analysis, or evaluation shall be available upon request for inspection by the student's parent/guardian. For the purpose of this policy, "instructional material" does not include academic tests or assessments.

A parent may inspect, upon request, a survey created by a third party before the survey is administered or distributed to a student.

The Superintendent or designee will be responsible for implementing any procedures necessary to protect the privacy of participating students and to provide parents with access to surveys within a reasonable time before administration or distribution.

The School District will notify parents of this policy at least annually at the beginning of the school year and within a reasonable time of any substantive change in policy. Where practical, the District will also directly notify parents annually at the beginning of the school year when surveys, analyses, or evaluations are scheduled or anticipated. Parents shall have the opportunity to opt their child out of participation in any survey, analysis, or evaluation. Students who are 18 years of age or older may opt out of such surveys, analyses, or evaluations.

Parents or eligible students who believe their rights have been violated may file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office of the U.S. Department of Education.
