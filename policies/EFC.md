Free lunches for eligible students will be made available according to procedures established by the Bureau of Nutrition Health & Safety.  Care should be taken to provide these lunches in such a way as to avoid overtly identifying students.

Parents will be informed at the beginning of each school year of the eligibility requirements for participation by their children.  However, in accordance with the guidelines of the program, no child who a teacher believes is improperly nourished will be denied a free or reduced price lunch simply because proper application has not been made by the parent or guardian.

School employees shall take great care to observe whether students are properly nourished, and to refer the student to the Guidance Department and school nurse if inadequate nutrition is suspected.
