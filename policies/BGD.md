It is expected that the Superintendent and administrative staff will need to issue regulations implementing policies of the School Committee.  Many of these will be routine from year to year; others will arise in special circumstances; some will be drawn up under specific directions from the Committee.

The Committee may review the regulations developed by the Superintendent for the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School whenever they appear inconsistent with policy, goals, or objectives of the district, but it will revise or veto such regulations only when, in the Committee's judg¬ment, they are inconsistent with policies adopted by the Committee.

The Committee will not officially approve regulations except as re¬quired by state law or in cases when strong community attitudes, or possible student or staff reaction, make it necessary or advisable for a regulation to have the Committee's advance approval.

**Rules Pertaining to Staff and Student Conduct**

Under Massachusetts’s law, the Superintendent is required to publish "the district’s policies pertaining to the conduct of teachers and students."  Codes of discipline, as well as procedures used to develop such codes shall be filed with the Department of Education for information purposes only.  Standards of conduct will be included in staff and student handbooks.  These handbooks will be reviewed and approved annually by the School Committee.
