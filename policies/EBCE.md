#### Emergency Weather Provisions

When circumstances of weather, power failure, lack of water or heat, work stoppage, epidemic, or other civil or natural emergencies make it impossible or unsafe to open (or keep open) the school, the Superintendent may cancel school for the day or postpone the opening time of school. If the Superintendent does close the school under the above granted authority, he/she will notify, as soon as the situation allows, members of the School Committee.   

In the event of weather related problems, it is the policy of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical District School Committee to open school if buses can travel safely.  Otherwise a decision is made to cancel school and is announced on radio and television stations.  The school website will also inform staff and students of cancellations or delays.  A computerized phone call will go out to all students regarding any school cancellations.  

Parents should be reminded that they retain their responsibilities for the safety of their children on bad weather days when school may be in session.  Decisions by parents not to send their children to school on days when weather conditions are questionable should be respected.
