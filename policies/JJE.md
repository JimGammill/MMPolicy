In general, the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee disapproves of fund-raising in the community by students for school activities.  Especially discouraged is the sale of goods produced by companies for profit, such as magazines, candy, and similar items.
 
Exceptions to this policy: 

1.	Sale of tickets to scheduled athletic events and school dramatic and musical performances.	
2.	Sale of advertising space in school publications.		
3.	A fund-raising activity approved by the Superintendent-Director.	
4.	Proposals to raise funds for charitable purposes or for benefit of the school or community provided such proposals have been individually approved by the Assistant Superintendent-Director/Principal and Superintendent-Director.		

No money collections of any kind may be held in the school without the specific consent of the Superintendent.
