#### A.	Overview

The School Committee recognizes that individuals and organizations in the community may wish to contribute money, supplies, or equipment to enhance or extend the instructional program.  This policy is intended to establish guidelines and procedures for such gifts in compliance with Chapter 44 Section 53A of the Massachusetts General Laws.

The School Committee has the authority to accept such gifts and donations as may be made to the District by resolution duly passed at a public meeting.  The School Committee may authorize through general resolution, that the Superintendent or his/her designee be authorized to accept gifts of cash or property valued up to $5,000.00.  Gifts exceeding $5,000.00 shall be authorized by separate resolutions.  The School Committee shall be notified monthly of any gifts or donations accepted by the Superintendent or his/her designee.

No donations shall be accepted without the approval of the Superintendent or his/her designee, or the School Committee.

#### B.       Gifts and Donations

All gifts must be evaluated according to the following considerations:

   - source of gift
   - age and condition of gift
   - cost of installation of gift	
   - cost of maintaining or upgrading the gift
   - all safety, liability insurance, and regulatory issues
   - suitability of gift for intended purpose
   - issues raised by acceptance of the gift
   - whether the gift would increase workload of district staff

The Administration reserves the right to refuse to accept any gift which does not contribute toward the achievement of the goals of this District.

Any gift accepted by the School Committee or its designee shall become the property of the District, may not be returned without the approval of the School Committee, and is subject to the same controls and regulations as are other properties of the District.

The School Committee shall be responsible for the maintenance of any gift it accepts, unless otherwise stipulated. For non-cash gifts and donations in excess of $5,000, the Business Office should record the value of said gifts in the General Ledger. 

The School Committee will make every effort to honor the intent of the donor in its use of the gift, consistent with the educational program of the District.  The School Committee may choose to decline the gift if it does not further the goals of the District.

In no case shall acceptance of a gift be considered to be an endorsement by the School Committee of a commercial product or business enterprise or institution of learning.

A potential donor will inform the department/program of their wish to make a donation.
  
Acknowledgement and acceptance of a gift or donation will be made by Administration of all gifts received by the District. A receipt of the gift or donation shall be made on the form provided by the Business Office.  In no event shall the District supply any valuations for the purposes of tax deductions; it is up to the donor to provide the value.

#### C. Scholarships

The students of the Minuteman District have benefited from the generous donations of its supporters.  The District has welcomed such support and wishes to continue to maintain and build relationships with its community and family members, and business partners.

The Minuteman School Committee accepts individual donations of any amount for the General Scholarship Fund.

Named scholarships may be established within the General Scholarship Fund for initial gifts totaling $1,000.00 or more.  These named scholarships will be disbursed to graduating seniors according to their criteria until the balances decline below the annual award level, at which point the scholarships will be closed and the remaining balances will be transferred to the General Scholarship Fund.  Additional donations to named scholarships will be accepted at any time.

Perpetual named scholarships may be established by a minimum initial donation totaling $10,000.   In order to guarantee that a contribution will live on in perpetuity, the sum is protected and only the interest is used to fund annual scholarships that satisfy the terms specified by the donor.  

The School Committee shall formally approve any named scholarships before they are established.

All scholarship funds received by the District will be held in a separate account and deposited in a savings bank,  trust company, national bank, banking company, or cooperative bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth, and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) pursuant to Chapter 44, Sections 55 and 55B.

Award recipients will be selected annually by the Principal upon recommendation of the Minuteman Scholarship Committee.

#### D. Computer/Related Technology Donations

All gifts of computer and/or other technology equipment must be approved by the manager of information services and, whenever possible, must be in compliance with District hardware standards as defined in the District’s Technology Plan.

All equipment must be in good working order or capable of being restored to good working order by District personnel.

Donors must provide software licenses for any donated software, including operating system software.

Recognition of the donation shall follow the procedure in “B” above.

#### E. General Conditions

Any accepted donations of  equipment having a value of $5,000.00 or more, or computer equipment of any value, must be reported to the Assistant Superintendent of Finance to be tagged and added to the fixed assets system.

A complete list of all donated equipment, supplies, materials, or furniture must be given to the Business Office.  The list must include, to the extent possible, source of the donation, serial numbers, descriptions, models, brands, and approximate values.  In the case off expendable supplies and office furniture, exact quantities and descriptions must be reported.
