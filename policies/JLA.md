A noncompulsory accident insurance plan totally administered by an insurance company may be made available to students.  The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District does not assume any responsibility regarding service, claims, or other matters relating to the insurance program.

All students participating in competitive athletics shall be required to be covered by a medical insurance plan.

Special student accident insurance coverage for students participating in Chapter 74 off-campus projects and approved work-based learning activities and for those who play interscholastic sports shall be purchased by the District.  Such insurance shall be a prerequisite for student participation in these programs.
