### RESOLUTION ON ADVISORY COMMITTEES

The Minuteman School Committee believes that Advisory Committees play a key role in guiding the improvement of Minuteman programs. To improve the effectiveness of Minuteman Advisory Committees, the School Committee believes that:

1.	Advisory Committee members need to be aware of, and in compliance with, the appropriate State and Federal laws and regulations.  In particular, Advisory Committees must be in compliance with the State Open Meeting Laws.

2.	Advisory Committee members need to be familiar with the latest version of the State's "Career and Technical Education Advisory Committee Guide." Advisory Committee members are encouraged to follow the suggestions and to use the forms provided by this guide whenever practical.

In accordance with this resolution, the Superintendent is directed to:

1.	Provide all Advisory Committee members with a copy of this resolution.

2.	Ensure that all Advisory Committee members are familiar with the appropriate State and Federal laws, particularly Massachusetts General Laws, MGL in particular, the Open Meeting laws.  Copies of these laws should be provided to all Advisory Committee members.

3.	Provide each Advisory Committee member with a copy of the latest Career and Technical Education Advisory Committee Guide.

4.	Develop a method of evaluating the performance of Advisory Committees.

5.	Revise the School Committee meeting schedule to ensure that Advisory Committee recommendations are gathered and presented to the School Committee in accordance with the appropriate regulations.  The meeting schedule change must ensure that there is sufficient time for the School Committee to respond to the Advisory Committee recommendations.
