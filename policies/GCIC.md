The Superintendent and the other administrators bear major responsibilities for educational leadership in the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District.  It is essential that each administrator continue to grow in both the knowledge of current developments in vocational education and in the skills needed to carry out the responsibilities of a particular position.  Accordingly, each administrator, the Superintendent included, will develop an individualized  professional growth plan that will include:

1.	Specific "growth" objectives to be accomplished.

2.	Means by which the objectives are to be accomplished:  conferences, workshops, conventions, academic courses, sabbatical leaves, and individual reading and study program.

3.	Activities above and beyond the ordinary which will support an administrator's growth as a professional educator:  leadership in a professional group, curriculum construction, businesses and industries, educational travel and visitations participating in team efforts to introduce educational improvements, and planning and carrying out other research and development activities.

4.	Provisions for a desirable balance between time spent in professional growth activities and the time required for carrying out the responsibilities of the position.

5.	Provisions for recording and evaluating professional growth activities with the view of giving credit in the evaluation of an administrator for his/her efforts to grow professionally.
