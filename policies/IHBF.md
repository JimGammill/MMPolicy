Minuteman Career & Technical High School will furnish home/ hospital educational instruction to those students who are unable to attend classes for 14 school days due to a physical injury, medical situation, or a severe emotional problem.  The Massachusetts regulation requiring educational services in the home or hospital is 603 CMR 28.03(3)(c). It reads as follows:

>Upon receipt of a physician's written order verifying that any student enrolled in a public school or placed by the public school in a private setting must remain at home or in a hospital on a day or overnight basis, or any combination of both, for medical reasons and for a period of not less than fourteen school days in any school year, the principal shall arrange for provision of educational services in the home or hospital. Such services shall be provided with sufficient frequency to allow the student to continue his or her educational program, as long as such services do not interfere with the medical needs of the student. The principal shall coordinate such services with the Administrator for Special Education for eligible students. Such educational services shall not be considered special education unless the student has been determined eligible for such services, and the services include services on the student's IEP.

To qualify for this service, the student needs to complete the appropriate State form: Temporary Home & Hospital Physicians Statement Form completed by a medical doctor requesting the home / hospital educational instruction, stating the reasons why, and estimating the time the student will be out of school and potential return date.  This form is available through the Special Education Department and when completed, needs to be sent to the schoolâ€™s Administrator of Special Education.

Educational instruction, provided in a home/hospital setting, is offered in core academic subjects and in subjects that do not require laboratories and/or specialized equipment.  The instruction is designed to provide maintenance in the core academic courses so that when the student returns to school, he/she will not be at a disadvantage because of the illness or hospitalization. 

In all cases, home/hospital educational instruction is subject to the availability of a qualified instructor.
