The minutes of a School Committee meeting, along with documents and other exhibits used during the open or Executive Session, constitute the written re¬cord of Committee actions; they are legal evidence of the ac¬tions.  Therefore, the clerk of the School Committee will be responsible for reporting in the minutes all actions taken by the Committee.

Minutes will include:
 
1.	a statement on the nature of the meeting (regular or Executive Session);
2.	the date, time, place, members present or absent, annotated as to arrival and departure times, 
	if during the meeting;
3.	a summary of the discussion on each subject (minutes need not be transcripts of everything said), a list of the documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or Executive Session, and the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including all votes (for Executive Sessions, by recorded roll call votes); and notation of formal adjournment.
  
If documents are presented at the meeting that were not provided by the school administration, they may be entered in to the official record of the meeting only by direction of the chair or by vote of the school committee.  Materials and exhibits not formally accepted by the chair or by vote of the Committee will be kept in the Committee correspondence file.  

Copies of the draft minutes will be either emailed or mailed to all Committee members so they will receive them at least 4 days in advance of the meeting at which the minutes are to be approved.

Existing minutes, associated materials and exhibits will be made available to the public upon request in accordance with the public records laws, whether they have been approved or are in draft form. Materials relating to performance evaluations and deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals will be released only in accordance with Massachusetts General Law.

Whenever possible, the minutes of one meeting will be approved at the following meeting.  

The approved minutes will become permanent records of the Committee. Minutes of public meetings and minutes of Executive Sessions that have been declassified will be in the custody of the Superintendent who will make them available to interested citizens upon request.

Approved and released minutes will also be posted on the District website, and one permanent copy will be kept at the District office, as required by the Public Records Division of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.    The documents shall be maintained in form and material as required by state laws and regulations.    

**Executive Session minutes:  *Separate minutes shall be prepared for each separate Executive Session purpose*.**  The Committee shall periodically review the Executive Session minutes to determine whether continued non-disclosure is warranted, and vote to “release” those minutes and other records for which disclosure would no longer defeat the purposes of the Executive Session. Minutes that pertain to ongoing litigation or negotiations, that are within an exemption to the Public Records Law, G.L. c. 4, § 7, cl. 26, or are governed by attorney-client privilege, do not have to be released. A determination to release the minutes will be included in the subsequent meeting minutes.  The School Committee will respond to a request to inspect or copy Executive Session minutes within 10 days of request and promptly release the records if they are subject to disclosure.  If the School Committee has not performed a review to determine whether the requested Executive Session minutes are subject to disclosure, it must do so “not later than the next meeting or 30 days,” whichever is sooner.
