Students who have met all local requirements and have passed the required state assessments (MCAS) will be granted a traditional High School Diploma.  Students who have fulfilled all local requirements and have not passed the requisite state assessments at the time of graduation will be granted a Certificate of Attainment.  Both groups of students will participate in the graduation ceremonies with no implied or stated distinction made between the two categories of graduates.  If after graduation, passing MCAS scores are received for students who heretofore received Certificates of Attainment; those students will be issued High School Diplomas.
