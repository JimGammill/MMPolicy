#### I.	INTRODUCTION

Minuteman High School (Minuteman) is a public vocational technical school located on a scenic campus in Lexington and Lincoln, Massachusetts. Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District (District) is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.  Minuteman is committed to providing quality vocational technical programs to the students of the communities it serves.

An admission process is necessary in vocational technical schools where space is a limiting factor. Vocational technical program majors are designed and equipped to serve a specific maximum number of students safely.  Consequently, a complex of such shops and laboratories may lack both the space and flexibility to accommodate all applicants during some years.  Therefore, a selection process is necessary. All applicants to grades nine through twelve at Minuteman will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admissions Policy.  The District Committee approved this policy for a 2nd reading on October 22, 2019.

#### II.	EQUAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY

The District admits students and makes available its advantages, privileges, and courses of study without regard to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, homeless status, or gender identity and expression, ancestry, genetic information, or marital/parental status.

Students with limited English proficiency may request that a qualified representative from Minuteman assist them in completing the necessary forms. They may also request an interpreter during the entire application and admissions process.

Students with disabilities may voluntarily self-identify for the purpose of requesting reasonable accommodations during the entire application and admission process.

Information on limited English proficiency and disability submitted voluntarily by the applicant, for the purpose of receiving assistance and accommodations during the entire application and admission process, will not adversely affect the applicant’s admission to the school.

#### III.	ELIGIBILITY

**Resident Students**   
Any eighth, ninth, or tenth  grade student who is a resident of the  District, and who expects to be promoted by their local district into the grade they seek to enter, is eligible to apply for fall admission or admission during the school year, subject to availability of openings at Minuteman.  Resident students will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admissions Policy.   The District gives priority for admission to resident students according to this policy, the District Regional Agreement, and state laws and regulations.

**Nonresident Students**   
Students who are not residents of the District are given lowest priority in the selection process. All nonresident applicants must file a *Chapter 74 Vocational Technical Nonresident Student Tuition Application* with the Superintendent of their district-of-residence in accordance with the Massachusetts Department of Education *Guidelines for the Vocational Technical Education Program Nonresident Student Tuition Process* pursuant to M.G.L. c. 74.  [www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions](https://www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions)).  April 1st is the deadline for this application to be filed with the local Superintendent of the nonresident community. Nonresident students will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admissions Policy. 

**School Choice**    
The District does not participate in the School Choice Program, unless the School Committee’s annual required vote on the program determines otherwise.

**McKinney-Vento**      
The District complies with federal law to ensure that all homeless children and youth have equal access to the same free, appropriate public education as provided to other children and youth.  Minuteman has a designated staff person to serve as the Homeless Education Liaison, whose role it is to assist homeless children to enroll in school and to receive the educational services for which they are eligible, and to ensure that homeless youth participate fully in the opportunities at Minuteman without segregation or stigmatization.

**Home Schooled Students**   
Students presently being formally home schooled may apply for admission to Minuteman, including admission to Minuteman during the school year, provided all Admissions Policy Criteria are followed. 

#### IV.	ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

The District is governed by a Regional Agreement that recognizes a School Committee composed of one member with residency consideration from each member town. The District is administered by a superintendent.  It is the responsibility of the District Superintendent   to   supervise   the administration of the policies and procedures required to admit and enroll applicants in conformity with this Admissions Policy.  The District has an admissions committee assigned by the Superintendent. 

To ensure that students from the member towns can attend the school, the District will establish an annual minimum number of seats designated for each member town. Annually, the Admissions Committee makes a recommendation to the School Committee regarding the number of seats available for new students for the coming school year, and minimum number of seats reserved for each member town.  These allocations may vary from year to year. Minuteman has an Admissions Director appointed by the Superintendent.  Responsibilities of the Admissions Director include:

a.  Determination of standards for admission;

b.  Development and implementation of admission procedure;

c.  Oversee the processing and ranking of applications;

d.  Acceptance of students according to the procedure and criteria in the Admission Policy;

e.  Establishment and maintenance of waiting list of acceptable candidates. 

#### V.	RECRUITMENT

Minuteman disseminates information about the school through a variety of methods.

- Minuteman Staff provide informational presentations to 8th grade classes in member town schools from September to November.

- Interested students from the member town schools visit Minuteman during scheduled tour days.

- An Open House is scheduled during the fall and/or winter.  Prospective students and their parents/guardians have an opportunity to visit all the vocational-technical programs and speak with teachers about course offerings.

- Parents/guardians may request individual visits, mini-tours and informational sessions.

- Prospective students are also given the opportunity to shadow a present Minuteman student within their desired career/technical major.  The visiting student may shadow a single career/technical major during a shadow day.  All shadow days must be pre-approved by the Admissions Director and a parent/guardian.

- Prospective students and their parents/guardians are encouraged to visit the Minuteman website ([www.minuteman.org](https://www.minuteman.org)) for a complete viewing of the school’s educational philosophy and mission, academic and vocational-technical programming, and campus life activities.  The admissions policy and procedures are also available on the website.  A printed copy of the admissions policy can be obtained by contacting the Admissions Office at 781-861-6500.


#### VI.	APPLICATION PROCESS

**Application Process For Fall Admission to the 9th, 10th, or 11th Grade**   

An applicant must complete a multi-step process for applying to Minuteman for fall admission to the 9th,10th, or 11th grade. The application process is started by filling out and submitting online an application found on the www.minuteman.org website. 

*The Admissions Director may require an applicant’s parent or guardian to verify legal residency within the District.*

**Completed applications shall include several documents:**

a.	For applications to grade 9:  Once Minuteman receives a completed application, Minuteman will send the applicant’s present school a “Request for Records” form.  This is an official request to receive information related to the Selection Criteria (Section VII). This includes math, English, science and social studies grades from 7th and 8th grade (to date), 7th and 8th grade Attendance Report of absences (to date), 7th and 8th grade Discipline Record (to date), and a recommendation from any school staff or other adult qualified to assess the student’s potential for success in vocational technical education.  

b.	For applications to grade 10, or 11:  Once Minuteman receives a completed application, Minuteman will send the applicant’s present school a “Request for Records” form.

From the previous two years, this includes math, English, science and social studies grades, Attendance Report of absences, Discipline Record, and a recommendation from any school staff or other adult qualified to assess the student’s potential for success in vocational technical education.  
  
c.	After all of these records are received by Minuteman, the student/parent will be contacted for an interview at the school. This interview is the final step in the application process.  If the applicant or parent/guardian cannot provide transportation to Minuteman for the interview, a representative from Minuteman will go the local school to interview the applicant or coordinate arrangements for an interview.

If incomplete applications are received, the following procedures will be followed:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	The Admissions staff at Minuteman will notify the student, parent/guardian, or the local school guidance counselor regarding an incomplete application and will request completion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	If after notifying the local school guidance counselor and parent/guardian, the application remains incomplete for twenty (20) school days, the application will be placed in an inactive file and only reactivated by the timely submission of required documents.

**FOR TRANSFER ADMISSION DURING THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR INTO THE 9th, 10th, or 11th GRADE**

Students from other schools are eligible to apply for transfer admission to Minuteman during the current school year to grades 9 through 11. Transfer students will be evaluated using the criteria contained in this Admissions Policy.

Transferring to Minuteman during the current school year will be allowed only as space  is available in specific vocational programs, as determined by the school administration. The applicant follows the admissions process described above.  

*The Admissions Director may require an applicant’s parent or guardian to verify legal residency within the District.*

**FOR TRANSFER ADMISSION FROM ANOTHER CHAPTER 74 APPROVED PROGRAM**

Applications from students who are enrolled in a Chapter 74 state-approved vocational technical education program in another school (transfer students) will be considered for admission (including admission during the school year), if they wish to pursue the same program of study at Minuteman. 

Students who currently reside in or relocate into a member community of the District will follow the admissions procedures stated above. 

Students who reside or relocate to a nonmember community and wish to pursue the same program of study at Minuteman may apply, but must seek and obtain the approval of the district-of-residence Superintendent in accordance with the MA Department of Elementary & Secondary Education *Guidelines for the Vocational Technical Education Program Nonresident Student Tuition Process* pursuant to M.G.L. c. 74:   [www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions/](https://www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions/) as discussed in Section III.
	
Transfer applicants must meet all standard admissions policy criteria including attending an interview. Students who wish to apply for 12th grade admission into their current program of study will be considered on a case by case basis. 

**LATE APPLICATIONS**

Applications received after the deadline set annually by the Admissions Office will be evaluated using the same criteria as other applications.  Students whose applications are late but who meet the criteria for admission will be considered only after qualified students who met all deadlines. If the school is projected to be full, qualified late applicants will be placed on the waiting list.

**WITHDRAWN STUDENTS**

**TIMELINES**

Applications are accepted starting in the fall of the student’s 8th grade year.  Students who have completed the application process, which includes a completed application form, all necessary paperwork submitted, all records received at the school, and interview completed, will be reviewed for admission.

Date|Actions|
---|----|
February 15|	Deadline for resident students to complete the application process for March 1st review|
March 1|	Notification of acceptance, denial, or wait list for resident student applications submitted by February 15th.| 
March 8|	Resident students must confirm acceptance of offer of enrollment|

The administrator serving as the Admissions Director at Minuteman will review all fully completed applications. Each application will be checked for accuracy before awarding rating points in each category. After awarding rating points, each category will be totaled. Resident and nonresident applicants will be ranked from high to low. The minimum ranking is calculated annually by ranking all applicants from top to bottom and then determining the number of applicants to fill the Freshman Class.  Only qualified students are accepted. 

Nonresident town applicants are evaluated using the criteria in this Admissions Policy and will be placed on the applicant list after resident applicants. Nonresident applicants on the list will only be accepted after all qualified resident applicants have been accepted. 

After a point total for each resident application has been determined, all applications are placed in order of their “point total” and town of residence. Resident applications are then accepted in the order of the point total they have achieved, subject to the minimum number of seats set aside for each member town.   The applicant with the highest point total is accepted first, the applicant with the second highest point total is accepted second, and so on until all district-wide, member town openings are filled.

#### IX:	ENROLLMENT

To enroll at Minuteman for the fall, applicants must have been promoted to the grade they seek to enter by their local school district.  In addition, they must have passed courses in English language arts, or the equivalent, and math for the school year immediately preceding their enrollment at Minuteman. Applicants failing either or both subjects are required to enroll in and pass comparable summer school course(s) provided by their local school district or another school district, prior to admission into the District.

Acceptance and enrollment at Minuteman is based upon the accuracy and completeness of a student’s application.  The District reserves the right to revoke its acceptance of any student, at any time, if it determines that the student, the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s), or the student’s sending school district provided inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information during the application process.

#### X.      VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL PROGRAM PLACEMENT/EXPLORATORY

All 9th graders who enroll at Minuteman shall participate in a half-year vocational technical exploratory program (September – January), designed to help students learn about their talents and interests relative to a variety of different vocational-technical fields. During the first week of exploratory all students will spend one period in each of Minuteman’s vocational/technical programs. After this mini-exploratory, students will spend three to five days in at least nine (9) vocational/technical programs. and are evaluated and assessed in the following areas: conduct, willingness to follow instruction, task completion/workmanship, personal safety and safety habits, attendance and punctuality. Students can receive a maximum of 100 total points. The total points accumulated during a vocational/technical rotation translate as follows: 

Total Points Accumulated|	Earned Letter Grade|  |  |  |
---|---|---|---|---|---|
90 - 105|	A	| |  |  |  |
80 - 89|	B	| |  |  |  |
70 – 79|	C	| |  |  |  |
60 – 69|	D	| |  |  |  |
59-below|	F | |  |  |  |

At the end of the exploratory period, students will select their program of choice, as well as a second and third choice. Students may be admitted into their first choice program based on the point total they received in all shops during the exploratory program. If a student’s point total in all shops combined is so low that they were not placed in their first, second or third choice programs because the programs were filled by students with higher point totals, the student will meet the guidance counselor who will present a list of programs that have openings. This process continues until all students are placed. 

If a nonresident student selects and is admitted into a program that is different than the one for which they has been approved for nonresident tuition, a new Chapter 74 Vocational Technical Education Nonresident Student Tuition Application must be completed and approved for the new Chapter 74 vocational technical education program in accordance with the MA Department of Elementary & Secondary Education *Guidelines for the Vocational Technical Education Program Nonresident Student Tuition Process* pursuant to M.G.L. c. 74: [www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions/](http://www.doe.mass.edu/cte/admissions/)  guidelines and upon written approval of the sending district. 

Students who enroll in Minuteman after grade 9 may explore vocational technical programs that have openings, before making a program selection. Students are evaluated by each vocational technical teacher during the period of exploration. If the number of enrollees seeking a program major exceeds the number of openings, the student’s rank order would determine the enrollee or enrollees who are placed in the program major. 

Students who wish to transfer from one program major to another during the school year may apply for transfer. Transfer requests, regardless of residency, will be considered subject to the availability of openings in the requested program. 


#### XI.	REVIEW and APPEALS
