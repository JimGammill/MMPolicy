The School Committee recognizes that individuals and organizations in the community may wish to contribute money, supplies, or equipment to enhance or extend the instructional program.  This policy is intended to establish guidelines and procedures for such gifts in compliance with Chapter 44 Section 53A of the Massachusetts General Laws. The School Committee has the authority to accept such gifts and donations as may be made to the District by resolution duly passed at a public meeting.  The School Committee may authorize through general resolution, that the Superintendent or his/her designee be authorized to accept gifts of cash or property valued up to $5,000.00.  Gifts exceeding equal to or exceeding $5,000.00 shall be authorized by separate resolutions.  The School Committee shall be notified monthly of any gifts or donations accepted by the Superintendent or his/her designee.

No donations shall be accepted without the approval of the Superintendent or his/her designee, or the School Committee.
