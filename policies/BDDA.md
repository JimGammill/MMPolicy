#### Emergency Powers of the Superintendent

From time to time, emergency situations arise which would call for immediate and decisive action by the Superintendent that, under more normal situations, would clearly be beyond the scope of his/her duty and authority.  It shall be the policy of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee that the Superintendent shall act in emergency situations to preserve and protect lives and property.

1.	In those situations that arise within the schools where the School Committee has provided no guidelines for administrative action, the Superintendent shall have power to act, but his/her decisions shall be subject to review by action of the Committee at its next regular meeting.  It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to inform the Committee promptly of such action and the possible need for a policy.

2.	When circumstances of weather, power failure, lack of water or heat, work stoppage, epidemic, or other civil or natural emergencies make it impossible or unsafe to open (or keep open) the school. If the Superintendent does close the school under the above granted authority, he/she will notify, as soon as the situation allows, members of the School Committee.
