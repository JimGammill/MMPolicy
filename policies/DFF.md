When students in the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Districtâ€™s   programs perform services, including repairs and other projects for private individuals and governmental entities, as part of their technical training, fees shall be charged to cover the cost of materials, parts and incidentals, such as insurance.

Instructors in programs that receive any funds in payment of such fees will deliver all cash received to the Business Manager or the Business Office on a daily basis.

The Business Manager shall be responsible for the establishment of procedures for the handling of program fees.  Such fees shall be separately accounted for and shall be deposited weekly in the bank approved for such purposes.  Such fees may be held by the Treasurer in a reserve for appropriation and may be used for the purchase of additional supplies and to meet operating incidental costs, but only through the normal School purchasing procedures and with the proper authorization.  When such funds are used for this purpose, a charge shall be made against the income tally of the program, which will utilize the material.  The application of such funds must be appropriately accounted for within the fiscal year.

The Business Manager shall maintain separate records to document individual program activities.

The School Committee expects that the Superintendent and/or the Business Manager will collect all fees for services and/or projects upon completion of the work.
