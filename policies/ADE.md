The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School shall maintain a safe and nurturing educational environment where students and others can work and learn without fear.  The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School will not tolerate violence or injury to staff or students.  The school will not tolerate any weapons (as defined in Weapons in Schools policy JICI) at any school activity or on any school district property.  The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee policies pertaining to school safety and student discipline shall be fairly and firmly enforced, criminal misconduct shall be reported to the proper law enforcement authority, and school district staff shall cooperate with any subsequent criminal prosecution.  The provisions of M.G.L. 71:37H & 71:37L, prohibiting firearms on school property shall be strictly enforced.

It is the policy of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School to endeavor to provide a safe environment in which students can learn and participate in all programs offered or sponsored by the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School.  Providing for the safety of students, employees and visitors while at school and/or participating in school sponsored activities is the responsibility of all school personnel.  If a school department employee confronts a situation that the employee considers to be unsafe for any reason, the employee should take all reasonable steps within his/her ability to eliminate the potential for harm to others and thereafter report the circumstances involved to the Principal.  The Superintendent may, from time to time, promulgate “administrative procedures” to effectuate the goals of this policy.

The Superintendent shall keep the School Committee informed of any violations of the Safe Schools Policy without violating any individual’s right to privacy.
