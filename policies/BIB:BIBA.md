### SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEMBER CONFERENCES, CONVENTIONS AND WORKSHOPS

Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee members are encouraged to engage in activities that will broaden their vision and knowledge of education and increase their competence as they function on a meeting-by-meeting basis on the Committee.

These “educational opportunities/activities” for School Committee members take many forms:

1.	Membership in local, state, and national School Committee and School Board Associations;
2.	Reading of newsletters, periodicals and books about education and School Committee operation; 
3.	Visiting schools with exemplary programs;
4.	Attendance and participation at clinics, workshops, conferences and conventions, at the local, state and national levels, is encouraged.  
    * The Superintendent will inform the School Committee of educational conferences relating specifically to School Committees; and
    * Members desiring to attend out-of-state conferences and conventions should request the Chairperson to place this matter on the agenda for School Committee approval.
