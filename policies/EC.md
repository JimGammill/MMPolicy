#### Management

The School Committee's most important function is to provide for the education of children, and it recognizes that the education of children is dependent upon many factors, including a proper physi-cal environment that is safe, clean, sanitary, and as comfortable and convenient as the facilities will permit or the use requires.

The Superintendent will establish procedures and employ such means as may be necessary to provide accurate information in regard to the nature, condition, location, and value of all property used by the school; to safeguard the property against loss, dam¬age, or undue depreciation; to recover and restore to usefulness any property that may be lost, stolen or damaged; and to do all things necessary to ensure the proper maintenance, cleanliness, and safekeeping of school property.

The supervision over the care and safekeeping of property used by the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District will be the general responsibility of the Superintendent.  The Superintendent will develop a comprehensive and well-defined plan for the pro¬per maintenance, cleanliness, and safekeeping of the school build¬ing and grounds to ensure that they are well main-tained, equipped, and staffed and report to the School Committee no less than annually.

#### Maintenance

The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee can "adopt an annual operating and maintenance budget."  The maintenance and repair program is viewed as a continuing long-term effort to maintain the appearance and functioning efficiency of the building and grounds.

The maintenance, repair and cleaning of school facilities (building and sites) are the direct responsibility of the Director of Facilities.

#### Security

The School building constitutes one of the great investments of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District.  It is deemed in the best interest of the district to protect the investment adequately.

Security should mean not only maintenance of a secure (locked) building but protection from fire hazards and faulty equipment and safe practices in the use of electrical, plumbing, and heating equipment.  The Committee requires and encourages close cooperation with local police and fire departments and with insurance company inspectors.

Records, architectural drawings and funds shall be kept in a safe place and under lock and key when required.

Access to the school building and grounds outside of regular school hours shall be limited to personnel whose work requires it.  An adequate key control system shall be established which will limit access to buildings to authorized personnel and will safeguard against the potential of entrance to buildings by keys in the hands of unauthorized persons.

The school building shall be closed and locked after the conclusion of the last school activity.

If an authorized school or community group is using the building in the evening, or on non-school days, the building shall be opened for such activity and secured again after its conclusion.

No unauthorized person or group shall be granted access to the secured building by any employee.  Authorization may be granted only by the School Committee or by the Superintendent-Director and his/her staff.

Protective and preventative devices, designed to be used as safeguards against illegal entry and vandalism, shall be installed when appropriate to the individual situation.
