**Expenditures Under the Budget**

The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District is a legal entity created by the Commonwealth and by agreement among participating municipalities.  As such, it has the following powers, and other powers as granted by law:

1.	To adopt an annual operating and maintenance budget.
2.	To receive and disburse funds for any district purpose.
3.	To incur temporary debt in anticipation of revenue to be received from any source.
4.	To receive any grants or gifts for the purposes of the regional district school.

All purchasing shall be in compliance of Chapter 30B, Uniform Procurement Act and other acts approved by the State Legislature.

The Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School Committee appoints the  treasurer and may appoint an assistant treasurer and other personnel to manage and operate the expenditure program and the business affairs of the school district.  

The Committee, under provisions of law and of the regional agreement, assesses member municipalities for expenses of the school district.

There are two important fiscal controls over the expenditures of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District Committee:

1.	The Committee must submit an annual report to each of the member towns containing a detailed financial statement and a statement showing the method by which the annual charges assessed against each town were computed, together with such additional information relating to the operation and maintenance of the school as may be deemed necessary by the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical District School Committee or by the Selectmen of any member town.

2.	The books of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District Committee shall be subject to an annual audit by a private accounting firm.
