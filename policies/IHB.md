The purpose of off-campus student work projects shall be to promote learning relevant to the studentâ€™s chosen major.  Students may also contribute to non-profit, public-service projects and other community service activities.

These projects will provide Minuteman students with the most advantageous learning environment in which to develop skills.  

The School District expects that the above persons shall comply with Chapter 268A of the Massachusetts General Laws regarding the conduct of public officials and employees.

Proposed projects will be presented to the Superintendent for review and shall align with the competencies of the program, meet all federal and state safety and health guidelines and, where possible, help foster the development of good will in our member communities. Projects will be prioritized based upon an objective process developed by the Superintendent with the involvement of the Director of Career and Technical Education, Advisory Committee members and appropriate community representatives. The Superintendent will inform the School Committee of all off-site work projects.
