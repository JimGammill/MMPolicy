All eligible staff shall have the right to self-organization and the right to form, join or assist any employee organization for the purpose of bargaining collectively through representatives of their own choosing free from interference, restraint or coercion.  The Labor Relations Commission shall prescribe rules and regulations and establish procedures for the determination of appropriate bargaining units.  A staff member shall have the right to refrain from all organization activities, except for the payment of a service fee if such payment is prescribed by law and a bargaining agreement.

The Collective Bargaining Agreement prohibits any association representative from causing, condoning, encouraging, supporting or taking part in any strike, slow down or withholding of nonvoluntary services or any other interference with the operation of the school district.
