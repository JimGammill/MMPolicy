The Minuteman School Committee wishes to ensure that School Committee members have adequate access to the information necessary to provide responsible oversight of the District.  At the same time, the School Committee wishes to avoid overburdening the administration with requests for information.  

Requests by School Committee members for information shall be channeled through the appropriate subcommittee chair or, if the subject of the request does not fall within the purview of any subcommittee, then through the School Committee Chair, either of whom may choose to forward the request directly to the Superintendent or to place the matter on the agenda for consideration at an upcoming meeting.  The Superintendent will coordinate the timely response to information requests forwarded in this manner.

If the relevant chair or subcommittee denies or unreasonably delays forwarding the request, or if the Superintendent fails to respond within 10 working days after receiving a properly forwarded request, the individual member may appeal to the full School Committee. 

#### Appeal Procedure:
  1.	Member submits written request to the School Committee Chair with copy to the Superintendent.
  2.	School Committee Chair places request on the next regular School Committee meeting, subject to requirements of the Open Meeting Law (MGL 30A, S20 – 21).
  3.	School Committee determines whether and in what form to refer the request to the Superintendent.

In its deliberation and vote, the Committee may consider input related to the specific nature, relevance, availability, and estimated time or cost to fulfill the request, as well as confidentiality or other special concerns that may apply.  Any information assembled by the Superintendent or other District staff acting upon such a vote of the full School Committee will be provided to all of its members.

Communications between the Committee and the Superintendent may be further governed by law, by other District policies, and by elements of the Superintendent’s employment contract.  Nothing in this policy is intended to preclude or prevent an individual School Committee member from exercising his/her rights under the Public Record Law (MGL 66, S10).
