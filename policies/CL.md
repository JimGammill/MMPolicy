The School Committee may from time to time require reports from the Superintendent concerning general or specific conditions, issues or other matters affecting or occurring within the school. 

The Superintendent shall at such time as he/she deems appropriate prepare reports covering the activities, affairs, programs, or other matters or issues affecting or relating to the school and the administrator’s recommendations with regard thereto and present same to the School Committee. 

Upon receiving reports from outside agents such as the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the auditor, fire department, health department and others, the Superintendent shall inform the School Committee of the receipt of the report by the time of the School Committee’s next meeting.  The Superintendent will notify the School Committee of his/her timetable for release of the report and of action he/she has taken pursuant to recommendations made in the report. 

Upon Committee approval, reports will be made available to the public and used as one means to inform parents and citizens, the Commissioner of Education and others of the programs, activities and affairs of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District.
