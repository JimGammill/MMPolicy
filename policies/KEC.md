The School Committee, though it is ultimately responsible for all curriculum and instructional materials (including library books), recognizes the need and right of students to free access to many different types of books and materials.  It also recognizes the right of the professional staff to select books and other materials supportive of the school system's educational philosophy and goals.  		

Criticism of a book or other materials used in the schools may be expected from time to time.  In such instances:		

1.  If a parent requests that his/her own child not read a given book, the teacher and/or appropriate school administrator will attempt to resolve the situation, perhaps by arranging for use of alternative material meeting essentially the same instructional purpose.  This does not apply however, to basic program texts and materials.		

2.  The Committee will not permit any individual or group to exercise censorship over instructional materials and library collections, but recognizes that at times a reevaluation of certain material may be desirable.  Should an individual or group ask to have any book or other material withdrawn from school use:  

	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The person who objects to the book or other material will be asked to sign a written complaint documenting the criticism.		
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Following receipt of the formal complaint, the Superintendent-Director will provide for a reevaluation of the material in question.  The Superintendent-Director will arrange for the appointment of a review committee from among the faculty to consider the complaint. 		
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.  The Superintendent will review the complaint and the review committee's reevaluation and will render a decision in the matter.  Should the decision be unsatisfactory to the complainant, it may be appealed to the School Committee.  The School Committeeâ€™s decision will be final.		

In summary, the School Committee assumes final responsibility for all books and instructional materials it makes available to students; it holds its professional staff accountable for their proper selection.  It recognizes rights of individual parents to raise questions about materials used by their own children; it will provide for the reevaluation of materials in library collections upon formal request.  On the other hand, students' right to learn and the freedom of teachers to teach will be respected.
