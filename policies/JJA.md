All student trips which include late night or overnight travel must have approval of the School Committee prior to raising funds or scheduling the trip.  The School Committee will also consider the educational value of the trip in relation to the cost prior to granting initial approval.  Overnight trips should offer significant educational benefits to students that clearly justify the time and expense of the trip.  Such trips should be appropriate for the grade level.

Final approval will not be granted until all preparations for the trip have been completed including, but not limited to, all logistical details involving transportation, accommodation arrangements and fundraising efforts.   The School Committee requires that final approval be sought no less than 30 days prior to the scheduled trip dates.

Teachers and other school staff are prohibited from soliciting for privately run trips through the school system and in the schools.  The School Committee will only review for approval school-sanctioned trips.  The School Committee will not review or approve trips that are privately organized and run without school sanctioning.
