Staff members may undertake and engage in private employment for which the staff member may be paid by outside individuals or concerns, so long as said activities do not interfere with the duties of the professional staff member in the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District, do not occur during school hours, and so long as such activities do not reflect unfavorably upon the School District. No district resources can be used in the conduct of any employment or volunteer work not associated with the school.
