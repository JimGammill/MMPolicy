**Licensing of School Bus Drivers:**

Inasmuch as the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District contracts for transportation services, the regular school bus drivers are not employees of the School District.  However, because the safety and welfare of children are involved, the Superintendent shall secure verification from the contractor that all legal and health requirements have been fulfilled and that the Registrar of Motor Vehicles has properly licensed all bus drivers.
